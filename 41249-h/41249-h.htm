<h2><a id="PREFACE"><i>PREFACE</i></a></h2>

<p class="no-indent-drop"><i><strong>THE</strong> collection of these humorous paragraphs has extended over a
number of years. Even a small beginning became a source of such
entertainment that the collection grew and grew, always without any
thought of publication.</i></p>

<p><i>The man who can not laugh has yet to be found. Therein lies that
immediate appeal to a common ground which the sense of humor gives,
and it has been a conspicuous characteristic of those who look to the
public for appreciation and support. Lord Palmerston and Abraham
Lincoln were two notable examples of men for whom sympathy quickened
through their ready wit, and no political speaker drives home his
arguments half so well as he who can introduce a witty illustration.
The joke has ever been a potent factor in combating oppression and
corruption, in ridiculing shams. It has embalmed some reputations, and
has blasted others. It is the champion of the weak against the strong,
and has often illuminated for us, as in a flash, a glimpse of
character or custom that would otherwise have been lost to the world.</i></p>

<p><i>There is only one similar collection of which I am aware, the &ldquo;Jest
Book&rdquo; by Mark Lemon, who was for twenty-nine years the editor of
&ldquo;Punch.&rdquo; Alas that there should be fashions in jokes as well as in
hats, for much of his book that we know must have been humorous
reading to his contemporaries, leaves us, of the present generation in
America, indifferent.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>I shall be glad if some of my readers are minded to do a graceful act
and send me, in return, some paragraphs to add to my collection.</i></p>

<p><i>I wish to take this opportunity to thank the following publications
for the paragraphs borrowed from their columns:</i></p>

<h2><a id="AMONG_THE_HUMORISTS_AND_AFTER-DINNER_SPEAKERS">AMONG THE HUMORISTS AND AFTER-DINNER SPEAKERS</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent-drop"><strong>THERE</strong> is a delicious flavor about this story of a Virginia lady,
married to a man who, though uniformly unsuccessful in his hunting
trips, boastingly spoke of his &ldquo;killings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day, returning from a trip, with the usual accompaniment of an
empty bag, it occurred to him that his wife would make fun of him if
he returned without even one proof of his oft-boasted skill. So he
purchased a brace of partridges to deceive his trusting spouse. As he
threw them on the table in front of her, he observed: &ldquo;Well, my dear,
you see I am not so awkward with the gun after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; replied the wife, turning from the birds with a grimace, after
a brief examination, &ldquo;you were quite right in shooting these birds
to-day; to-morrow it would have been too late.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>Uncle Toby was aghast at finding a strange darky with his arm around
Mandy&rsquo;s waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mandy, tell dat niggah to take his ahm &rsquo;way from round yo&rsquo; waist,&rdquo; he
indignantly commanded. &ldquo;Tell him yo&rsquo;self,&rdquo; said Mandy haughtily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a puffect stranger to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A Cockney tourist was on a visit to a Highland town famous for its
golf-links. Through wearing a pair of stiff leather gaiters several
sizes too large for him, he was compelled to walk bow-legged. Being a
very slow player, others were forced to wait for him at every hole. At
the fourth hole a Highlander after watching the visitor miss the ball
three times was unable to wait any longer, and drove his ball clean
between the tourist&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he of the gaitered legs yelled
furiously. &ldquo;Do you call that golf?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mebbe no,&rdquo; replied the Gael, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s very good croquet.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>After the sermon on Sunday morning the rector welcomed and shook hands
with a young German.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you a regular communicant?&rdquo; said the rector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the German, &ldquo;I take the 7.45 every morning.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>Meeting a negro, a certain Southern gentleman asked him how he was
getting on.</p>

<p>The negro assumed a troubled look, and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so far&rsquo;s physicality goes, I&rsquo;m all right; but I sure do have ma
troubles wif ma wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. What seems to be the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks money grows on trees, I reckon. All de time she keeps
pesterin&rsquo; me foh pinch o&rsquo; change. If it ain&rsquo;t a dollah it&rsquo;s half or a
quarter she wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth does she do with the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno. Ain&rsquo;t nevah give her none yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A mountaineer of one of the back counties of North Carolina was
arraigned with several others for illicit distilling. &ldquo;Defendant,&rdquo;
said the court, &ldquo;what is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joshua,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the man who made the sun stand still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quick as a flash came the answer, &ldquo;No, sir; I am the man who made the
moonshine.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;They thought more of the Legion of Honor in the time of the first
Napoleon than they do now,&rdquo; said a well-known Frenchman. &ldquo;The emperor
one day met an old one-armed veteran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How did you lose your arm?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sire, at Austerlitz.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And were you not decorated?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then here is my own cross for you; I make you chevalier.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your Majesty names me chevalier because I have lost one arm! What
would your Majesty have done had I lost both arms?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, in that case I should have made you Officer of the Legion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereupon the old soldier immediately drew his sword and cut off his
other arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no particular reason to doubt this story. The only question
is, how did he do it?</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A stranger in Boston was interested to discover, when dining with
friends once, that the dessert he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> would have classed as cream layer
cake at home was known in Boston as &ldquo;Washington pie.&rdquo; And the next
time he lunched at a restaurant, he ordered the same thing; but the
waiter put before him a rather heavy looking square of cake covered
with chocolate, instead of the cream cake the guest had made up his
mind to enjoy. A puzzled expression came over his face as he said
reprovingly, &ldquo;I ordered <i>Washington</i> pie, waiter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Washington pie, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; expostulated the disappointed man, &ldquo;I did not mean Booker
T.&mdash;I want <i>George!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>George Ade, automobiling in Indiana, dined at a country hotel among a
roomful of ministers.</p>

<p>The ministers, who were holding a convention in the town, were much
amused when Mr. Ade&rsquo;s identity was disclosed to them.</p>

<p>One of them said during dinner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does a humorist of your stamp feel, sir, in such reverend company
as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said Mr. Ade promptly, &ldquo;like a lion in a den of Daniels.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>It was a crowded tram car. Among those who could not find seats was a
young lady. Close to where she stood an old man was sitting. He
struggled as if to rise. The young woman cast a glance of scorn at one
or two men hiding behind newspapers. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t get up,&rdquo; she said
to the old man, &ldquo;I beg you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The conductor rang the bell and the
car went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> on. The old man&rsquo;s features worked convulsively and he mopped
his face with his handkerchief. At the next stopping place he again
tried to rise and again the young woman tried to stop him. &ldquo;I would
much rather stand,&rdquo; she said, continuing to block his way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care whether you would or not,&rdquo; said the old man, crimson with fury,
&ldquo;I want to get out. You&rsquo;ve made me come half a mile too far already.
Here, you, stop the car.&rdquo; But it was too late, the bell had already
rung and he had to wait until the next stopping place was reached.</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;I want some cigars for my husband for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, exactly; but he is a middle-aged man and always
dresses in black.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr., tells a story of his father:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father tells many stories. Sometimes he tells a new one. Not long ago
he related one to me that concerned a man who had imbibed rather too
freely. The man, in this condition, fell into a watering trough. To
the officer who came to help him out as he wallowed in the water, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Offzer, I ken save self. You save women an&rsquo; shildern.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;On Sunday, September 20, the wife of &mdash;&mdash; of a daughter. Others
please copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>Bret Harte was so frequently complimented as the author of &ldquo;Little
Breeches&rdquo; that he was almost as sorry it was ever written as was
Colonel John Hay, who preferred his fame to rest on more ambitious
works. A gushing lady who prided herself upon her literary tastes,
said to him once: &ldquo;My dear Mr. Harte, I am so delighted to meet you. I
have read everything you ever wrote, but of all your dialect verse
there is none that compares to your &lsquo;Little Breeches.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Harte, &ldquo;but you have put the
little breeches on the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>Mr. Knox, the Secretary of State in Taft&rsquo;s Cabinet, was formerly
engaged in the practise of law in Pittsburg.</p>

<p>One day, says a friend, Mr. Knox was much put out to find on his
arrival at his office that everything was topsy-turvy and that the
temperature of his rooms was much too low for comfort. Summoning his
office-boy, a lad but recently entered his employ, the lawyer asked
who had raised every window in the place on such a cold morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Muldoon, sir,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Muldoon?&rdquo; asked the attorney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The janitor, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who carried off my waste-basket?&rdquo; was the next question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Reilly, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is Mr. Reilly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man that cleans the rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Knox looked sternly at the boy and said: &ldquo;See here, Richard, we
call men by their first names here. We don&rsquo;t &lsquo;mister&rsquo; them in this
office. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And the boy retired.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he reappeared and in a shrill, piping voice
announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman that wants to see you, Philander.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A Scottish parson, still on the under side of forty, was driving home
from an outlying hamlet when he overtook a young woman. He recognized
her as the maid of all work at a farm which he would pass, so he
pulled up and offered her a lift. Mary gladly accepted his offer and
they chatted pleasantly all the way to the farm gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; she said as she got down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Mary. Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; he told her politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mary obligingly assured him.</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A little girl was shown her newly-arrived baby brother. Looking at him
lovingly she said, &ldquo;When will he talk, mother?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh not for a long
time yet,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Yes, but when?&rdquo; persisted the child.
&ldquo;Well, not for a year or so.&rdquo; After thinking for minute the child
exclaimed, &ldquo;How funny. Miss Clark read out of the Bible this morning
that Job cursed the hour he was born.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>W. A. Sponsler, when in the Pennsylvania State Legislature, was given
to the making of very elaborate and florid speeches, and one day
brought an address to a close with &ldquo;<i>Vox populi, vox Dei</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you don&rsquo;t know the meaning of what Sponsler just said,&rdquo; said
Al Crawford to Hugh E. Mackin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; replied Mackin, indignantly. &ldquo;Of course, I know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know for ten dollars!&rdquo; suggested Crawford.</p>

<p>Mackin, still indignant, posted his part of the wager with another
member of the Legislature, and Crawford said tauntingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, tell us, what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Vox populi, vox Dei</i>,&rdquo; quoted Mackin, solemnly, &ldquo;as everybody knows,

<p>There is an old lady living in a small town in southern Pennsylvania
who makes great efforts to keep abreast of the times. Her
opportunities, however, are circumscribed, and she is sometimes
compelled to resort to her imagination. She went to a church sociable
lately, and as she entered the room one of the attendants said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, auntie. I am glad you came. We are going to have
tableaux this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied the old lady; &ldquo;I smelt &rsquo;em when I first came
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fifer was a dog of friendly and social habits, but when he wandered
into the lecture-tent at a well-known New Thought summer school and
went to sleep between the chairs, he did a very foolish thing. A woman
coming in poked him in the ribs with her parasol, startling him from
his peaceful dreams, and he sprang upon her with a savage bite. A man
grabbed him and he grabbed the man. The excitement was intense when an
earnest little woman standing on a chair cried, &ldquo;Some one hold the
Thought!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hang the Thought!&rdquo; shouted a man in the rear. &ldquo;Some one
hold the dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy was going away to school, full of high hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall make the football team and color two pipes the first year!&rdquo;
he said bravely.</p>

<p>His mother kissed him and wept. His father wrung his hand in silence.</p>

<p>They were too full for speech then.</p>

<p>But when he was gone, and they were calmer, they talked together of
him, and prayed his ambition might not carry him beyond his strength.</p>

<p>The car was entirely empty with the exception of one man, but as I

&ldquo;Madam, pleashe be kind &rsquo;nough to asshept thish plashe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing else for me to do, so I thanked him and sat down.
And for twenty blocks that idiot hung from a strap, swaying in the
breeze, with not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> a soul in the car but ourselves. Occasionally I have
been taken for other women; but I never before had any one think that

<p>Thomas Hill (the original &ldquo;Paul Pry&rdquo;) was endeavoring one evening to
cut up an orange in such a fashion as to represent a pig. After
strewing the table with about a dozen peels, he gave up the futile
experiment, saying, &ldquo;Hang the pig! I can&rsquo;t make him at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Hill,&rdquo; said Theodore Hook, pointing to the table; &ldquo;you have
done splendidly. Instead of a pig you have made a litter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An elderly churchwarden in shaving himself one Sunday before
church-time made a slight cut with the razor on the extreme end of his
nose. Quickly calling to his wife, he asked her if she had any
court-plaster in the house. &ldquo;You will find some in my sewing basket,&rdquo;
she said. The warden soon had the cut covered. At church in assisting
with the collection he noticed everyone smile as he passed the plate,
and some of the younger people laughed outright. Very much annoyed, he
asked a friend if there was anything wrong with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> appearance.
&ldquo;Well, I should think there is,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;What is that on your
nose?&rdquo; &ldquo;Court-plaster.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;it is the label from a
reel of cotton. It says, &lsquo;Warranted 200 yd. long.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A visitor to a Sunday-school was asked to address a few remarks to the
children. He took the familiar theme of the children who mocked Elisha
on his journey to Bethel&mdash;how the youngsters taunted the poor old
prophet and how they were punished when two she bears came out of the
wood and ate forty-and-two of them. &ldquo;And now, children,&rdquo; said he,
wishing to learn if his talk had produced any moral effect, &ldquo;what does
this story show?&rdquo; &ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; came from a little girl well down in
the front, &ldquo;it shows how many children two she bears can hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A curate who had left his parish on account of the attentions of his

<p>On a recent occasion before leaving Marlborough House new clothes were
ordered for Prince Edward, and according to custom a tailoress was
sent to fit him at a time which would not interfere with his lessons.
The tailoress duly arrived and was ushered to the Prince&rsquo;s
sitting-room, but on the door being opened she paused as she saw that
a gentleman, whose face was turned toward the fireplace, was sitting
smoking and chatting with the children. Prince Edward, whose manner is
most friendly, at once ran forward and told her to come in, and seeing
that she still hesitated added in a reassuring voice, &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
mind, it&rsquo;s only grandpapa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A physician engaged a nurse, recently graduated, for a case of
delirium tremens. The physician succeeded in quieting his patient and
left some medicine, instructing the nurse to administer it to him if
he &ldquo;began to see snakes again.&rdquo; At the next call the physician found
the patient again raving. To his puzzled inquiry the nurse replied
that the man had been going on that way for several hours, and that
she had not given him any medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t I tell you to give it to him if he began to see snakes
again?&rdquo; asked the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t see snakes this time,&rdquo; replied the nurse confidently.
&ldquo;He saw red, white, and blue turkeys with straw hats on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after his entrance into political life Disraeli stood for a
certain Middlesex borough in the Conservative interest. It was a
&ldquo;personally conducted&rdquo; canvass, and, among others, the future Prime
Minister solicited the vote and interest of a well-to-do but somewhat
irascible farmer, who was supposed to be rather doubtful in his
political convictions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vote for you!&rdquo; he shouted when Mr. Disraeli made known the object of
his call. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d vote for the devil sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, quite so!&rdquo; said Mr. Disraeli, suavely, &ldquo;but in event of your

<p>He received the following reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you sir, call me a horse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A well-known New York clergyman was telling his Bible class the story

the boot, my lady was gratified to hear that her precious pet was

fear, whereat his father told him to think it not possible for the
animal to harm them, but the boy, remembering a previous encounter
with a goat, in which he came out second best, did not grow any

<p>&ldquo;Addie, run up to my room and get my blue ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> rosette, the

mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpots was too busy greeting her friends or giving close
attention to the speakers at the meeting to note that they smiled when

Comforter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark Twain in his lecturing days, reached a small Eastern town one
afternoon and went before dinner to a barber&rsquo;s to be shaved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a stranger in town, sir?&rdquo; the barber asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a stranger here,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a good lecture here to-night, sir,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;a
&lsquo;Mark Twain&rsquo; lecture. Are you going to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Clemens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got your ticket yet?&rdquo; the barber asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, you&rsquo;ll have to stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; Mr. Clemens exclaimed. &ldquo;It seems as if I always do have to
stand when I hear that man Twain lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the visit of the Shah Nasr-ed-Din to England he dined one night
with the then Prince of Wales, now King Edward. Among the courses was
one of asparagus, a delicacy unknown to the Shah. He considered it for
a time, discovered that the head alone was nice to eat, ate it
accordingly and flung the rest of the stalk over his shoulder. The
other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> diners were somewhat flabbergasted, but the tactful Prince, not
wishing his Persian guest to feel that he had done anything
ridiculous, promptly followed his example, throwing his own stalks
over his shoulder. Naturally all the courtiers imitated him in turn,
and the amazement of the royal servants was extreme to see the air
suddenly full of flying asparagus stalks from one end of the lengthy
room to the other.</p>

<p>On one of his frequent trips to the other side, the weather being more
than ordinarily rough, and the passengers on deck but few, the late
Bishop Potter saw a lady reclining on one of the benches, and the
unearthly pallor on her face and the hapless languidity of her manner
indicated that she had reached that state of collapse which marks the
limit of sea-sickness. &ldquo;Touched by this piteous spectacle and
approaching the poor creature, in my most compassionate tone I asked,
&lsquo;Madam, can I be of any service to you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not open her eyes, but I heard her murmur faintly: &lsquo;Thank
you, sir, but there is nothing you can do&mdash;nothing at all.&rsquo; &lsquo;At least,
madam,&rsquo; said I tenderly, &lsquo;permit me to bring you a glass of water.&rsquo;
She moved her head feebly and answered: &lsquo;No, I thank you&mdash;nothing at
all.&rsquo; &lsquo;But your husband, madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the gentleman lying there
with his head in your lap&mdash;shall I not bring something to revive him?&rsquo;
The lady again moved her head feebly, and again she murmured faintly
between gasps: &lsquo;Thank you, sir, but&mdash;he&mdash;is&mdash;not&mdash;my&mdash;husband.
I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know&mdash;who he is!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Bobby, how do you like church?&rdquo; asked his father, as they

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; ejaculated the young man. &ldquo;How much did you get, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did I get? Why, what do you mean? How much what?&rdquo; asked the

<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember when the funny old man passed the money

<p>One day a fussy fellow met Father Healy of Dublin by the seashore and
thus accosted him: &ldquo;Father Healy, I am undergoing a cure, and I take a
tumbler of sea water three times a day. Now, I&rsquo;ve had my full
allowance to-day, but do you think I might have one, just one, tumbler
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father Healy put his head on one side and looked at the ocean, lost in
thought. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, at last, with a gravely judicial air, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it would be missed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of his grandma&rsquo;s maids of honor tells the following story of
Prince Eddie when he was a few years younger:</p>

<p>Just after King Edward&rsquo;s coronation, when he underwent an operation
for appendicitis and was lying convalescent, he sent for his
grandchildren.</p>

<p>The little ones trooped into the room, cautioned by their nurse that
they must keep very quiet, and stood about their grandfather&rsquo;s bed. He
talked with them for a few minutes and they replied in awed whispers.
Then when the nurse told them they must go, Prince Eddie said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, grandpa, can&rsquo;t we see the baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rossetti&rsquo;s fondness for humorous stories and his interest in a
particular soldier of fortune, or rather of misfortune, are shown in
Hall Caine&rsquo;s autobiography. Beginning life as the secretary of Ruskin,
the man ultimately lived on his cleverness and audacity and made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Rossetti in particular his conscious and delighted victim. Feeble as
Rossetti was, the visits of this man did him good, and he laughed all
the evening and told droll stories himself. One of the latter was of a
man near to death to whom the clergyman came and said: &ldquo;Dear friend,
do you know who died to save you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, meenister, meenister,&rdquo; said
the dying man, &ldquo;is this a time for conundrums?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is interesting to recall, apropos of the recent Milton celebration,
an anecdote of Milton that was told in an old family letter written in
1762, recently quoted in the columns of the London &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly you may not have heard this anecdote concerning him. John
Vallack&mdash;who, I believe, died after you came to Tavistock&mdash;told me it,
and he lived in London in 1696. Milton, as you know, was blind.
Charles the Second had the curiosity to see him, and said: &lsquo;God hath
punished you for your malice, etc., to my father by taking away your
eyesight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; says Milton, &lsquo;but before I lost my eyes he lost his head.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

leading.</p>

<p>The band soon got a long way ahead, and on reaching a bend, halted for
a few minutes&rsquo; rest. Presently up galloped a mounted officer in hot
haste and shouted for the band sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by getting out of sight of the leading
company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were not out of sight, sir,&rdquo; answered the sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by telling me that!&rdquo; exclaimed the officer in a
rage. &ldquo;You were out of sight, I saw you myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several ladies sat after a card party at the University Club a few

a good meal. But, I suppose, on an average, he doesn&rsquo;t smoke more than
once a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ian Maclaren was talking to a group of literary beginners in New York.
&ldquo;Begin your stories well,&rdquo; he said emphatically. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like

this excellent beginner of stories added: &ldquo;Always bear in mind the

<p>That famous Scotch physician, Dr. George Fordyce, was unfortunately
somewhat given to drink, and though he never was known to be dead
drunk, yet he was often in a state which rendered him unfit for
professional duties. One night when he was in such a condition, he was
suddenly sent for to attend a lady of title who was very ill. He went,
sat down, listened to her story, and felt her pulse. He found he was
not up to his work. He lost his wits and in a moment of forgetfulness
exclaimed, &ldquo;Drunk, by Jove!&rdquo; Still he managed to write out a mild
prescription. Early next morning he received a message from the noble
patient to call on her at once. Dr. Fordyce felt very uncomfortable.
The lady evidently intended to upbraid him either for giving an
improper prescription or for his disgraceful condition, but to his
surprise and relief she thanked him for his prompt compliance with her
pressing summons, and then confessed that he had rightly diagnosed her
case. That unfortunately she occasionally indulged too freely in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
drink, but that she hoped he would preserve inviolable secrecy as to
the condition in which he had found her. Fordyce listened to her as
grave as a judge, then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, you may depend on me. I shall be as silent as the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A friend of Dean Swift one day sent him a turbot as a present by a
servant lad who had frequently been on similar errands but had never
received anything from the dean for his trouble. Having gained
admission he opened the study door, and putting down the fish on the
floor cried out rudely, &ldquo;Master has sent you a turbot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo;
said the dean rising from the chair, &ldquo;is that the way you deliver a
message? Let me teach you better manners. Sit down in my chair; we
will change places, and I will show you how to behave in future.&rdquo; The
boy sat down, and the dean going out came up to the door, and making a
low bow said, &ldquo;Sir, master presents his kind compliments, hopes you
are well, and requests your acceptance of a small present.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo;
replied the boy. &ldquo;Return him my best thanks, and there&rsquo;s half-a-crown
for yourself.&rdquo; The dean thus caught in his own trap laughed heartily
and gave the boy a crown for his ready wit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought not to be surprised by anything at my time of life,&rdquo; said a
well-known minister, &ldquo;but one of my flock did manage to take my breath
away. I was preaching about the Father&rsquo;s tender wisdom in caring for
us all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I illustrated by saying that the Father knows which
of us grows best in sunlight and which of us must have shade. &lsquo;You
know you plant roses in the sunshine,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and heliotrope and
geraniums; but if you want your fuchsias to grow they must be kept in
a shady nook.&rsquo; After the sermon, which I hoped would be a comforting
one, a woman came up to me, her face glowing with pleasure that was
evidently deep and true. &lsquo;O, Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, I am so grateful for that
sermon,&rsquo; she said, clasping my hand and shaking it warmly. My heart
glowed for a moment, while I wondered what tender place in her heart
and life I had touched. Only for a moment, though. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she went on,
fervently, &lsquo;I never knew before what was the matter with my
fuchsias.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are some singular discounts allowed in the book trade. They were
happily illustrated on one occasion by Mark Twain. One day while the
humorist was connected with a publishing house he went into a book
store and picking up a volume asked the price. He then suggested that
as a publisher he was entitled to 50 per cent discount. To this the
clerk assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I am also an author,&rdquo; said Mark, &ldquo;it would appear that I am again
entitled to 50 per cent discount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the clerk bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And as a personal friend of the proprietor,&rdquo; he modestly continued,
&ldquo;I presume that you will allow me the usual 25 per cent. discount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another bow from the salesman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled the unblushing humorist, &ldquo;under these conditions I
think I may as well take the book. What&rsquo;s the tax?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk took out his pencil and figured industriously. Then he said
with the greatest obsequiousness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As near as I can calculate we owe you the book and about 37-1/2
cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde Fitch tells a new story of Whistler. The artist was in Paris at
the time of the coronation of King Edward, and at a reception one
evening a duchess said to him: &ldquo;I believe you know King Edward, Mr.
Whistler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; replied Whistler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I met the King at a dinner-party
last year, and he said that he knew you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the painter, &ldquo;that was just his brag.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A London friend who was a member of the same club as Mr. Whistler
writes me this, which I have not seen before in print. It seems that
the gentle artist in making enemies had not paid his dues and was
dunned for them in vain. He either took no notice of requests for a
settlement, or replied to them with his usual airy mockery. Finally
the secretary wrote to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Whistler</i>&mdash;It is not a Nocturne in Purple, or a Symphony in
Blue and Gray, that we are after, but An Arrangement in Gold and
Silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This drew forth the required pounds and shillings.</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>Here is another story typical of the great maker of enemies:</p>

<p>Whistler had a French poodle of which he was extravagantly fond. The
poodle was seized with an affection of the throat, and Whistler had
the audacity to send for the great throat specialist Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Sir Morell, when he saw that he had been called in to treat a dog,
didn&rsquo;t like it much, it was plain. But he said nothing. He prescribed,
pocketed a big fee, and drove away.</p>

<p>The next day he sent post-haste for Whistler; and Whistler, thinking
he was summoned on some matter connected with his beloved dog, dropped
his work and rushed like the wind to Mackenzie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>On his arrival Sir Morell said gravely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Whistler? I wanted to see you about having my
front door painted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A story is told of a very popular cavalry officer. He was being tried
for drunkenness, and among other witnesses was his Irish orderly. The
court, anxious to give the officer every chance, put several questions
to this witness with a view of eliciting any facts that might be in
his master&rsquo;s favor. When the orderly said that his master, on going to
bed, had expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> a wish to be called early, the members of the
court-martial were distinctly pleased.</p>

<p>A man who gave special instructions to be called early could not,
surely&mdash;they argued to themselves&mdash;have been drunk. Hoping to get
favorable particulars, the judge advocate put a further question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did the major wish to be called early?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; he tould me it was because he was to be Queen of the May,&rdquo;
came the answer.</p>

<p>That settled it.</p>

cure the rheumatism from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> which he suffered. So he purchased several

guaranteed the goods in every particular. About two months later, says
the New York &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; Mr. Jenks revisited the shop, sought out the
proprietor and told his woful story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goods are the best in the house,&rdquo; declared the proprietor. &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; he said, in a reasonable tone used on unreasonable persons,
&ldquo;of course the shirts may have shrunk or faded a little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shrunk! Faded!&rdquo; bellowed Mr. Jenks. &ldquo;What do you think my wife said
to me, when I came down to breakfast yesterday with one of them on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the aggrieved Jenks, &ldquo;she looked at me a minute, and

awed by the number of doors that looked all alike. But she was sure of
her own and tapped gently on the panel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prattle looked at her visitor with reproach in her wide blue
eyes. &ldquo;Talk,&rdquo; she said eagerly, &ldquo;our baby talk? Well, I guess he can.
He&rsquo;s three months younger than my cousin&rsquo;s boy and he&rsquo;s a year ahead
of him in language. You know often people tell you their children can
say things, and when you hear them you have to work hard with your
imagination to tell what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s my cousin&rsquo;s baby&mdash;the one I spoke of. They declare that
child has a vocabulary of fifteen words, but, my dear, if you could
hear him. He says &lsquo;bay&rsquo; for bread, and &lsquo;flis&rsquo; for fish, and &lsquo;cang&rsquo; for
candle, and &lsquo;hort&rsquo; for horse, and &lsquo;apa&rsquo; for father. Now I&rsquo;ll try
Harold with those very words, and you&rsquo;ll see the difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say bread, Harold&mdash;bread&mdash;bre-e-ad.&rdquo;</p>

inquisitor, &ldquo;that if you would save that money, by the time you are as
old as I am you would own that big building on the corner?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do <i>you</i>
own it?&rdquo; inquired the smoker. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo;
said the young man.</p>

<p>A Lady going out for the day locked everything up carefully, and for
the grocer&rsquo;s benefit left a card on the back door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All out. Don&rsquo;t leave anything,&rdquo; it read.</p>

<p>On her return she found her house ransacked and all her choicest
possessions gone. To the card on the door was added, &ldquo;Thanks. We

<p>&ldquo;Edward Everett Hale,&rdquo; said a lawyer, &ldquo;was one of the guests at a
millionaire&rsquo;s dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The millionaire was a free spender, but he wanted full credit for
every dollar put out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And as the dinner progressed, he told his guests what the more
expensive dishes had cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This terrapin,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;was shipped direct from Baltimore. A
Baltimore cook came on to prepare it. The dish actually cost one
dollar a teaspoonful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he talked of the fresh peas, the hot-house asparagus, the Covent
Garden peaches, and the other courses. He dwelt especially on the
expense of the large and beautiful grapes, each bunch a foot long,
each grape bigger than a plum. He told down to a penny what he had
figured it out that the grapes had cost him apiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guests looked annoyed. They ate the expensive grapes charily. But
Dr. Hale, smiling, extended his plate and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would you mind cutting me off about $1.87 worth more, please?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe Jefferson had but one person with him who did not reverence the
man and the name.</p>

<p>This individual, one Bagley by name, was the property man and annoyed
the great comedian with undue familiarity. He had called Mr. Jefferson
&ldquo;Joey&rdquo; during his entire thirty years&rsquo; service.</p>

<p>Just previous to an auspicious opening in one of the big cities, Mr.
Jefferson discharged Bagley for humiliating him before a number of
friends. Bagley got drunk right away, and that night paid his way to
the gallery to see Mr. Jefferson present &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle.&rdquo; The angry
Frau has just driven poor, destitute Rip from the cottage when Rip
turns and, with a world of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> pathos, asks: &ldquo;Den haf I no interest in
dis house?&rdquo; The house is deathly still, the audience half in tears,
when Bagley&rsquo;s cracked voice responds: &ldquo;Only eighty per cent,
Joey&mdash;only eighty per cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dean Hole, the noted English clergyman who died recently, was the
leading figure in many humorous stories. On one occasion he was
crossing the Channel after a visit to the Continent, the voyage being
very stormy.</p>

<p>The Dean was a bad sailor and had suffered a great deal on the trip.
At Dover he was looking over the railway company&rsquo;s rules on the
station wall as a passenger came up. Said the Dean: &ldquo;After that stormy
voyage we have at least one advantage in making the subsequent trip to
London. I see the company carries returning empties at reduced rates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gilbert Stuart, though a celebrated artist, was likewise a great
braggart. On one occasion a great public dinner was given to Isaac
Hull by the town of Boston, and he was asked to sit for his picture to
the artist.</p>

<p>When Hull visited the studio Stuart took great delight in entertaining
him with anecdotes of his English success, stories of the marquis of
this and the baroness of that, which showed how elegant was the
society to which he had been accustomed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the midst of this grandeur, Mrs. Stuart, who did not
know that there was a sitter, came in with apron on and her head tied
up with some handkerchiefs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> from the kitchen, and cried out: &ldquo;Do you
mean to have that leg of mutton boiled or roasted?&rdquo; to which Stuart
replied, with great presence of mind, &ldquo;Ask your mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This story is related of an old-time Judge in Sullivan County, N. Y.:</p>

<p>During a session of court there was so much talking and laughter going
on that the Judge, becoming angry and confused, shouted in great
wrath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, here! We have decided half a dozen cases this morning, and I
have not heard a word of one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irving Bacheller, the author of &ldquo;Eben Holden,&rdquo; went a little farther
north than usual one summer while on his vacation, and penetrated
Newfoundland. He caught a good many fish, but this did not prevent his
keeping an eye on the natives. He was particularly impressed by the
men who spent the day lounging about the village stores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you fellows do when you sit around the store like this?&rdquo; he
asked of the crowd arranged in a circle of tilted chairs and empty
boxes and maintaining a profound silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled one of the oldest, &ldquo;sometimes we set and think, and
then again other times we jest set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long before his death Thomas B. Reed visited some friends at their
summer residence at Watch Hill, R. I. Late in the afternoon he was
driven up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> Westerly to take the 7 o&rsquo;clock train for Boston. It was
a warm evening, the horses lagged and he missed the train, the last
Boston-bound train stopping at Westerly that night.</p>

<p>As Mr. Reed had an important engagement in Boston early the next day,
he seemed worried until he learned that there was a Boston express
which passed Westerly at 9 o&rsquo;clock. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>Going to the telegraph office, he directed a telegram to the
superintendent of the road in Boston, and sent the following message:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you stop the 9 o&rsquo;clock express at Westerly to-night for a large
party for Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer came: &ldquo;Yes. Will stop train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Reed read the message, and smiled. When the train pulled in Mr.
Reed quietly started to board it, when the conductor said: &ldquo;Where is
that large party we were to stop for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the large party,&rdquo; replied Mr. Reed, and he boarded the train.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales is fond of telling a good story to his friends in
connection with his visit to Ottawa some few years ago. The
Prince&mdash;then Duke of York<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&mdash;stole away for a quiet bicycle spin early
one morning, and in his ramblings met a farmer, heading marketward,
his wagon temporarily stalled by the loss of a nut belonging to the
whiffletree bolt. His Royal Highness, with his usual democratic
kindness, assisted him in putting things right. On parting, the farmer
expressed his rough thanks and asked if he might know the name of the
person to whom he was indebted. The royal cyclist replied modestly: &ldquo;I
am the Duke of York. And may I ask whom I have the pleasure of
addressing?&rdquo; A broad, amused smile beamed from the farmer&rsquo;s face as he
said: &ldquo;Me! Me! Why, I&rsquo;m your uncle, the Czar of Russia!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;All right on behind there?&rdquo; called the conductor from the front of
the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; cried a shrill voice. &ldquo;Wait till I get my clothes on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The passengers craned their necks expectantly. A small boy was
struggling to get a basket of laundry aboard.</p>

<p>One of the jokes of which Kentuckians never grow weary concerns
Senator Blackburn and his loyal appreciation of the liquid products of
his native State. The Senator had gone to pay a visit to a friend of
his who lived many miles distant. His friend met the Senator as he
alighted at the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you Joe?&rdquo; his friend asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up against it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I lost the best part of my
baggage en route.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you misplace it, or was it stolen?&rdquo; his friend inquired
solicitously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said the Senator. &ldquo;The cork came out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once, during his second term, Grover Cleveland was asked to speak at a
function in a certain town, and when he arrived at the depot the wind
was blowing a gale, sleet was driving, and hailstones nearly as large
as marbles were fiercely falling. Of course, the inevitable brass band
was there, and at the sight of the President the performers struck up
with all the strenuosity at their command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the most realistic music I ever heard,&rdquo; remarked Cleveland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they trying to play?&rdquo; asked Secretary Olney, who accompanied
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hail to the Chief&rsquo;!&rdquo; replied the President, with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>The chaplain of one of his Majesty&rsquo;s ships was giving a magic-lantern
lecture, the subject of which was &ldquo;Scenes from the Bible.&rdquo; He arranged
with a sailor who possessed a gramophone to discourse appropriate
music between the slides. The first picture shown was Adam and Eve in
the Garden of Eden. The sailor cudgeled his brain but could think of
nothing suitable. &ldquo;Play up,&rdquo; whispered the chaplain. Suddenly a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
idea struck the jolly tar and to the great consternation of the
chaplain and the delight of the audience the gramophone burst forth
with the strains of &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one girl in the world for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The craze for giving and accepting coupons for purchases of
merchandise, to be redeemed by prizes, was given a more or less
merited rebuke by Nat C. Goodwin. He bought a bill of goods, and the
salesman offered him the coupons that the amount of the purchase
called for. Mr. Goodwin shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better take them, sir,&rdquo; persisted the clerk; &ldquo;we redeem them
with very handsome prizes. If you can save up a thousand coupons we
give a grand piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, look here,&rdquo; replied Mr. Goodwin, &ldquo;if I ever drank enough of your
whisky or smoked enough of your cigars to get a thousand of those
coupons I wouldn&rsquo;t want a piano. I&rsquo;d want a harp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Southern lawyer tells of a case that came to him at the outset of
his career, wherein his principal witness was a darky named Jackson,
supposed to have knowledge of certain transactions not at all to the
credit of his employer, the defendant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jackson,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;I want you to understand the
importance of telling the truth when you are put on the stand. You
know what will happen, don&rsquo;t you, if you don&rsquo;t tell the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yassir,&rdquo; was Jackson&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;in dat case I expects our side will
win de case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small boy who had recently passed his fifth birthday was riding in a
suburban car with his mother, when they were asked the customary
question, &ldquo;How old is the boy?&rdquo; After being told the correct age,
which did not require a fare, the conductor passed on to the next
person.</p>

<p>The boy sat quite still as if pondering over some question, and then,
concluding that full information had not been given, called loudly to
the conductor, then at the other end of the car: &ldquo;And mother&rsquo;s
thirty-one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the uptown banks, on a conspicuous corner, gained a bad name
with the daily crowd of New York pedestrians. Its financial standing
was of course beyond question, but its clock ran on a very eccentric
and confusing system. The timepiece stood in a spot easily observable
and was consulted for years in spite of its tendency to wander from
strict accuracy. A woman excusing her lateness for luncheon said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> she
thought she was on time by the clock in the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody can go by that,&rdquo; said her companion contemptuously. &ldquo;We

<p>A prominent railroad man hurried down the lobby of a Binghamton hotel
and up to the desk. He had just ten minutes in which to pay his bill
and reach the station. Suddenly it occurred to him that he had
forgotten something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, boy,&rdquo; he called to a negro bellboy, &ldquo;run up to 48 and see if I
left a box on the bureau. And be quick about it, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy rushed up the stairs. The ten minutes dwindled to seven and
the railroad man paced the office. At length the boy appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, suh,&rdquo; he panted breathlessly. &ldquo;Yas, suh, yo&rsquo; left it, suh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Boston minister tells of a little girl friend of his who, one day,
proudly displayed for his admiration a candy cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to eat it?&rdquo; the minister asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; it&rsquo;s too pretty to eat. I&rsquo;m going to keep it,&rdquo; the little
girl replied, as she stroked it with a moist little hand.</p>

<p>Several days later the minister saw her again, and inquired about the
cat.</p>

<p>A regretful look came into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;You see, I saved it and saved it, till it
got so dirty that I just <i>had</i> to eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My rubber,&rdquo; said Nat Goodwin, describing a Turkish bath that he once
had in Mexico, &ldquo;was a very strong man. He laid me on a slab and
kneaded me and punched me and banged me in a most emphatic way. When
it was over and I had gotten up, he came up behind me before my sheet
was adjusted, and gave me three resounding slaps on the bare back with
the palm of his enormous hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What in blazes are you doing?&rsquo; I gasped, staggering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No offense, sir,&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;It was only to let the office know
that I was ready for the next bather. You see, sir, the bell&rsquo;s out of

<p>When Blaine was a young lawyer, and cases were few, he was asked to
defend a poverty-stricken tramp accused of stealing a watch. He
pleaded with all the ardor at his command, drawing so pathetic a
picture with such convincing energy that at the close of his argument
the court was in tears and even the tramp wept. The jury deliberated
but a few minutes and returned the verdict &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; Then the
tramp drew himself up, tears streaming down his face as he looked at
the future &ldquo;Plumed Knight,&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;Sir, I have never heard so
grand a plea, I have not cried before since I was a child. I have no
money with which to reward you, but (drawing a package from the depths
of his ragged clothes), here&rsquo;s that watch; take it and welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other day an ingenious-looking person called with the message to
the housewife that her husband<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> had sent him for his dress suit, which
was to be pressed and redone by the tailor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the housewife, &ldquo;he said nothing to me about it. Did he
look quite well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum; he wuz in good health and spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he seemed quite as if he knew what he was about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did that, mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did he look as if he were quite content with things about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was all that, mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;it seems strange that he should only think of
that dress suit now, because it&rsquo;s ten years since he&rsquo;s dead and
buried, and I&rsquo;ve often wondered how he&rsquo;s been getting on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me; so sorry. Glad to have met you. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo; asked the other, when the stranger was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you asked him about his old complaint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Jowett of Oxford was a formidable wit. At a gathering at which he
was present the talk ran upon the comparative gifts of two Balliol men
who had been made respectively a judge and a bishop. Prof. Henry
Smith, famous in his day for his brilliancy, pronounced the bishop to
be the greater man of the two for this reason: &ldquo;A judge, at the most,
can only say, &lsquo;You be hanged,&rsquo; whereas a bishop can say, &lsquo;You be
damned!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Jowett, but if the judge says, &ldquo;&lsquo;You be hanged,&rsquo; you

Then her cheeks crimsoned.</p>

<p>No amount of persuasion or punishment could keep Johnnie from running
away. The excitement of being pursued and of being brought back to a
tearful family appealed to his sense of the dramatic and offset the
slight discomfort that sometimes followed.</p>

<p>Finally his mother determined upon a new method. She decided, after
many misgivings, that the next time Johnnie ran away no notice
whatever should be taken of it. He should stay away as long as he
pleased and return when he saw fit.</p>

<p>In a few days the youngster again disappeared. His mother was firm in
her resolve and no search was made. Great was poor Johnnie&rsquo;s
disappointment. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> managed to stay away all day, but when it began to
grow dark his courage failed and he started for home. He sneaked
ignominiously into the kitchen. Nobody spoke to him. Apparently his
absence had not been noticed. This was too much. As soon as
opportunity offered he remarked casually, &ldquo;Well, I see you&rsquo;ve got the
same old cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A gentleman who happened to come in rather late at a dinner found that
the guests had finished soup and were on with the next course. When he
had sat down a waiter came up and said, &ldquo;Soup, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; he
replied, whereupon the waiter went away. Another waiter, seeing he had
nothing, said to him, &ldquo;Soup, sir?&rdquo; He replied rather testily, &ldquo;No,
thank you.&rdquo; A third waiter, who saw him come in and took compassion on
him, placed the soup in front of him. &ldquo;Look here, my man, is this
compulsory?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir; it&rsquo;s mulligatawny,&rdquo; replied the waiter.</p>

<p>A big, burly, fierce-looking man and a meek, inoffensive-looking
little chap were sawing timber with a cross-cut saw. A strapping
Irishman, passing that way, stopped to watch them. Back and forth,
back and forth, they pulled at the saw. Finally the Irishman could
stand it no longer. With a whoop and a yell he rushed at the big man
and brought him to the ground, burying his knees deep into the
sawyer&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>Biff! Bang! Thump! Biff!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, letting him have one parting blow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> square on the
nose, &ldquo;now m&rsquo;bbe ye&rsquo;ll let the little felly hev it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver Herford once entered a doubtful-looking restaurant in a small
New York town and ordered a lamb-chop. After a long delay the waiter
returned, bearing a plate on which reposed a dab of mashed potatoes
and a much overdone chop of microscopical proportions with a
remarkably long and slender rib attached. This the waiter set down
before him and then hurried away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; called Herford, &ldquo;I ordered a chop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;there it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, so it is,&rdquo; replied Herford, peering at it closely. &ldquo;I thought it
was a crack in the plate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one of the elevators of a city skyscraper, as the elevator shot
toward the zenith, a stout man began to sputter. &ldquo;Bub-but,
rt-st-st-b&rsquo;r&rsquo;r&rsquo;r,&rdquo; he said, as the veins stood out upon his neck. At
the twenty-third story the stout man&rsquo;s eyes were nearly starting from
his head, and as he grasped the arm of the elevator man the latter
nervously pulled the lever, and the lift started for the bottom at a
terrific rate. The solitary passenger danced about, gurgling
spasmodically. As the car struck bottom, however, he rushed through
the door and up to an important individual, whose cap bore the screed
&ldquo;Starter.&rdquo; &ldquo;S-s-s-say,&rdquo; he sputtered, &ldquo;t-t-this is the th-th-third

<p>Some of Darwin&rsquo;s boy friends once plotted a surprise for the
naturalist. They slew a centipede, glued on it a beetle&rsquo;s head, and
also added to its body the wings of a butterfly and the long legs of a
grasshopper. Then they put the new insect in a box and knocked at the
great man&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;We found this in the fields,&rdquo; they cried with eager
voices. &ldquo;Do tell us what it can be.&rdquo; Darwin looked at the strange
compound and then at the boys&rsquo; innocent faces. &ldquo;Did it hum when you
caught it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Oh yes, sir,&rdquo; they answered quickly, nudging
one another, &ldquo;it hummed like anything.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the philosopher,
&ldquo;it is a humbug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man had been sent by the house-agents to take an inventory of the
drawing-room furniture. He was so long about his task that at last the
mistress of the house went to see what was taking place. She found the
man slumbering sweetly on the sofa with an empty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> bottle beside him;
it was evident, however, that he had made a pathetic though solitary
attempt to do his work, for in the inventory book was written, &ldquo;One
revolving carpet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The customs of military service require officers to visit the kitchens
during cooking hours to see that the soldiers&rsquo; food is properly
prepared. One old colonel, who let it be pretty generally known that
his orders must be obeyed without question or explanation, once
stopped two soldiers who were carrying a soup-kettle out of a kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;give me a taste of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the soldiers ran and fetched a ladle and gave the colonel the
desired taste. The colonel spat and spluttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, man! You don&rsquo;t call that stuff soup, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the soldier meekly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dishwater we was
emptyin&rsquo;, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ship upon clearing the harbor ran into a half-pitching,
half-rolling sea, that became particularly noticeable about the time
the twenty-five passengers at the captain&rsquo;s table sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that all twenty-five of you will have a pleasant trip,&rdquo; the
captain told them as the soup appeared, &ldquo;and that this little
assemblage of twenty-four will reach port much benefited by the
voyage. I look upon these twenty-two smiling faces much as a father
does upon his family, for I am responsible for the safety of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> this
group of seventeen. I hope that all thirteen of you will join me later
in drinking to a merry trip. I believe that we seven fellow passengers

<p>&ldquo;Extra Billy&rdquo; Smith, the Confederate General, was one of the most
irascible as well as one of the most patriotic of men. Upon one
occasion he was leading a regiment on a long and difficult march.
Weary and exhausted they halted for a rest by the wayside. When it
became necessary to move on, the General gave the order, but the tired
men remained stretched upon the ground. The order was repeated
peremptorily. Still no motion. By this time the temper of the General
was at white heat. He thundered out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get up and start at once I&rsquo;ll march the regiment off and
leave every d&mdash;&mdash;d one of you behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started.</p>

<p>A Boston lawyer, who brought his wit from his native Dublin, while

<p>&ldquo;Do you drink yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One rainy afternoon Aunt Sue was explaining the meaning of various
words to her young nephew. &ldquo;Now, an heirloom, my dear, means something

<p>&ldquo;The easiest money that I ever made,&rdquo; said a shipping man the other
day, &ldquo;was handed to me in New York not long ago. I was visiting there
and had a little time to myself, so I bought a paper and went down to
the river front. I saw an advertisement in the paper saying that a tug
was to be auctioned off that day, so I went to the place and stood
around examining the tug. After a while a man who had been watching me
came over and began asking questions. I told him I was interested in
boats and was from Philadelphia. Then he asked: &lsquo;What are you doing
down here?&rsquo; &lsquo;I came down to this auction sale,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said
the man, &lsquo;if you want to keep on the right side of the boys you&rsquo;ll do
something for me. Here&rsquo;s $100; do not bid on the tug.&rsquo; I took the
money and departed. I had not the slightest intention of bidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bride and groom had been much troubled by the stares of people at
hotels wherever they went. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> when they arrived at the next hotel the
groom called the colored head-waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have been bothered to death by people
staring at us because we are just married. We want to be free from
that sort of thing here. Now, here&rsquo;s two dollars, and remember I trust
you not to tell people that we are just married, if they ask you.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sah!&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;I un&rsquo;stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All went well that day. But the following morning when the couple came
down to breakfast the staring was worse than ever. Chambermaids in the
hall snickered; the clerks behind the desk nudged each other;
everybody in the dining-room stared. When the couple returned to their
room it was only to see a head sticking out of nearly every room down
the long hall.</p>

<p>This was too much.</p>

<p>This <i>was</i> the limit!</p>

<p>Angered beyond control, the groom went to the desk and called for the
head-waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, you old fool,&rdquo; said the groom, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I give you two
dollars to protect my wife and myself from the staring business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sah, you did,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon me soul, I didn&rsquo;t tell, sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how about this staring?&rdquo; asked the irate groom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse here
than anywhere. Did anybody ask if we were married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas, sah; several folks did,&rdquo; replied George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you tell them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tole &rsquo;em, sah,&rdquo; replied the honest negro, &ldquo;you wuzn&rsquo;t married at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thunderstorm overtook the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria when out
shooting in 1873 with old Emperor William of Germany and Victor
Emmanuel. The three monarchs got separated from their party and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> lost
their way. They were drenched to the skin, and, in search of shelter,
hailed a peasant driving a covered cart drawn by oxen along the high
road. The peasant took up the royal trio and drove on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who may you be, for you are a stranger in these parts?&rdquo; he asked,
after a while, of Emperor William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Emperor of Germany,&rdquo; replied his Teutonic majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, very good,&rdquo; said the peasant, and then, addressing Victor
Emmanuel, &ldquo;and you, my friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I am the King of Italy,&rdquo; came the prompt reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, very good, indeed! And who are you?&rdquo; addressing Francis
Joseph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Emperor of Austria,&rdquo; said the latter.</p>

<p>The peasant then scratched his head and said with a knowing wink:
&ldquo;Very good, and who do you suppose I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their majesties replied they would like very much to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I am his Holiness the Pope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum; the new minister, from your church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bridget. What did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>

As the man addressed evidently did not know her and looked rather
dazed, she saw her mistake and hurriedly apologized, saying: &ldquo;Oh, I

landed at a place where a camp-meeting was in full blast. Our friend,
the Dane, was greatly interested and took a front seat.</p>

<p>Near the close of the meeting one of the brethren went about among the

foot of his own steps; but Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; suddenly came into such forcible
contact with that tree that he was almost stunned. After recovering
his senses, he wandered about, but repeatedly bumped into the same
inoffensive barrier. At length he sank down on the ground and muttered
helplessly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Passionately,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I love books dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, like other men of genius, was absent-minded, and,
when a fit of inspiration seized him, he was oblivious to the things
of earth to a ludicrous extent. A story that is vouched for as true
illustrates this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The old-fashioned matches, in use in New England in Emerson&rsquo;s time,
were made in cards, or flat slabs, the matches being joined at the
foot, and separating at the top, like the teeth of a deep comb.
Emerson was accustomed, in the midnight watches, to lie awake
communing with his own thoughts, and, if any especial inspiration
developed itself, he would get up and write it down, lighting the lamp
for that purpose.</p>

<p>One night, Mrs. Emerson was awakened by her gifted husband&rsquo;s voice, as
he called to her plaintively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the matches, my dear? I have struck seven,
and not one will light. Where can I get some good ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Emerson got out of bed at once, and found the matches in their
accustomed place. Her husband had not touched them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what can you have been striking, in mistake for matches?&rdquo; she
asked, anxiously, and beheld her best carved tortoise-shell comb,
which the absorbed philosopher, had broken up, tooth by tooth, in
mistake for the card of matches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess that the subject of psychical research makes no great
appeal to me,&rdquo; Sir William Henry Perkin, the inventor of coal-tar

fairly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> long career, I have heard at first hand but one ghost story.
Its hero was a man whom I may as well call Snooks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snooks, visiting at a country house, was put in the haunted chamber
for the night. He said that he did not feel the slightest uneasiness,
but nevertheless, just as a matter of precaution, he took to bed with
him a revolver of the latest American pattern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He slept peacefully enough until the clock struck two, when he awoke
with an unpleasant feeling of oppression. He raised his head and

in that weird, bluish light he thought he discerned a small, white
hand clasping the rail at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; he asked tremulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no reply. The small, white hand did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;Answer me or I&rsquo;ll shoot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again there was no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snooks cautiously raised himself, took careful aim and fired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that night on he&rsquo;s limped. Shot off two of his own toes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Rev. Dr. Henson, then of Chicago, came to the New York
Chautauqua to lecture on &ldquo;Fools,&rdquo; Bishop Vincent introduced him thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, we are now to have a lecture on &lsquo;Fools&rsquo; by one
of the most distinguished&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here there was a long pause, the Bishop&rsquo;s inflection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> indicating that
he had finished. The audience roared with delight, and roared again,
so that it was some time before the sentence was concluded&mdash;&ldquo;men of
Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Henson, who is a man of ready wit, stepped to the front of the
platform, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I am not so great a fool as Bishop Vincent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and then he paused as if he had finished, and the audience went fairly
wild over the situation. When quiet was restored, Dr. Henson
concluded&mdash;&ldquo;would have you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every employee of the Bank of England is required to sign his name in
a book on his arrival in the morning, and, if late, must give the
reason therefor. The chief cause of tardiness is usually fog, and the
first man to arrive writes &ldquo;fog&rdquo; opposite his name, and those who
follow write &ldquo;ditto.&rdquo; One day, however, the first late man gave as the
reason, &ldquo;wife had twins,&rdquo; and twenty other late men mechanically
signed &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; underneath.</p>

<p>At a dinner in Washington there was told a Scotch story of a
parishioner who had strayed from his own kirk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you at the kirk on Sunday?&rdquo; asked the preacher of the
culprit on meeting him a day or two later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at Mr. McClellan&rsquo;s kirk,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you running about to strange kirks like that,&rdquo; continued
the minister. &ldquo;Not that I object to your hearing Mr. McClellan, but
I&rsquo;m sure you widna like your sheep straying into strange pastures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I widna care a grain, sir, if it was better grass,&rdquo; responded the
parishioner.</p>

<p>Perish the thought that the novelist or playwright should be tied down
to historical accuracy! Lady Dorothy Neville quotes an amusing
correspondence between Bulwer Lytton and her brother, Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Walpole: Here I am at Bath&mdash;bored to death. I am thinking of
writing a play about your great ancestor Sir Robert. Had he not a
sister Lucy, and did she not marry a Jacobite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walpole promptly replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Lytton: I care little for my family, and less still for Sir
Robert, but I know that he never had a sister Lucy, so she could not
have married a Jacobite.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>However, this mattered little to Lord Lytton, for his answer ran:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Walpole: You are too late! Sir Robert <i>had</i> a sister Lucy,
and she <i>did</i> marry a Jacobite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in defiance of history, the play &ldquo;Walpole&rdquo; was written.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a curious item, Joshua!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Lemington, spreading

calf, floating off Cape Cod the day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ma,&rdquo; replied old Mr. Lemington, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s all right about the two whales, Joshua, but what bothers me

<p>Captain Roald Amundsen, Norway&rsquo;s famous explorer, told this story
about a National Guard encampment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new volunteer, who had not quite learned his business, was on
sentry duty, one night, when a friend brought him a pie from the
canteen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As he sat on the grass eating pie, the major sauntered up in undress
uniform. The sentry, not recognizing him, did not salute, and the
major stopped and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you have there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pie,&rsquo; said the sentry, good-naturedly. &lsquo;Apple pie. Have a bite?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The major frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know who I am?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the sentry, &lsquo;unless you&rsquo;re the major&rsquo;s groom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The major shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Guess again,&rsquo; he growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The barber from the village?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe&mdash;&rsquo; here the sentry laughed&mdash;&lsquo;maybe you&rsquo;re the major himself?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right. I am the major,&rsquo; was the stern reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sentry scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good gracious!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;Hold the pie, will you, while I

<p>A player for many years associated with the late Richard Mansfield

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a fish is that, old man?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Greene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey calls it de Baptist fish,&rdquo; replied the fisherman, as he tossed it

<p>Governor Chamberlain of Connecticut used to tell of an old friend who,

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, with a look of mild surprise. &ldquo;The fact

smilingly said the caller. &ldquo;Oh, such a big baby for its age,&rdquo; and went

&ldquo;What a darling angel the baby is; how old is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Eighteen months,&rdquo;

leaving the caller stooped and kissed the baby and said: &ldquo;Bless its
little heart; how old is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ten months,&rdquo; shrieked the outraged
mother, but the caller tripped gaily away; she had not noticed the
replies to her questions, and had no idea and did not care how old the

<p>One afternoon during a recent sea voyage of Ex-Ambassador Choate the
waves were unpleasantly high, and the ship was rolling a bit, to the

<p>A certain minister was deeply impressed by an address on the evils of
smoking given at a recent synod. He rose from his seat, went over to a
fellow minister, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, this morning I received a present of 100 good cigars. I have
smoked one of them, but now I&rsquo;m going home to burn the remainder in
the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other minister arose, and said it was his intention to accompany
his reverend brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to rescue the ninety and nine,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Expecting a visit from the superintendent of an adjacent Sunday-school
one Sunday afternoon, one enterprising teacher, anticipating the line
of questions which would be asked of the scholars selected a boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> from
her class to answer each question. As she had figured it out, the
visitor would first ask the pupils the question, &ldquo;Who made you?&rdquo; and
the first pupil was, of course, to answer &ldquo;God.&rdquo; The next question was
to be &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; to which the answer was to be &ldquo;Of the dust of the
earth.&rdquo; Unfortunately between the time that Sunday-school was called
to order and the visiting superintendent took the floor, the first
pupil was taken sick and obliged to go home. The teacher did not have
the opportunity to readjust her forces, and when the first question
was asked, the second boy thought it a good opportunity for him to get
in his answer and have it off his mind; so to the question, &ldquo;Who made
you?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Of the dust of the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the visitor. &ldquo;God made you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; He did not,&rdquo; said the youngster. &ldquo;The little boy that God
made has gone home sick, and I am the dust of the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When General Grant was in London on his trip around the world he was
invited to Windsor Castle by Queen Victoria. The queen received the
party in one of the private audience chambers and chatted with General
Grant for a few moments before dinner was served.</p>

<p>Jesse Grant, then a small boy, was with the general, and stood just
behind him. As the general was talking, Jesse pulled impatiently at
his coat-tails a number of times. Finally, the general turned
half-way, and Jesse whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pa, can&rsquo;t I be introduced?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;I should like to present my son,
Master Jesse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queen shook Jesse&rsquo;s hand cordially, and that young man, thinking
it incumbent on him to say something, glanced approvingly around the
room and said: &ldquo;Fine house you have here, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Chicago mistress had given the butcher her daily order over the

countermanded an order she had given for some liver.</p>

<p>Calling up the butcher, she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember that I gave you an order this morning for a pound of
liver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the butcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I find that I can get along without it, and you need not send
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she could put down the receiver she heard the butcher say to
some one in the store:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut out Mrs. Blank&rsquo;s liver. She says she can get along without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An eloquent evangelist who was holding a series of protracted meetings
had been interrupted on several occasions by the departure of some one
of the audience. He determined to prevent further annoyance by making
an example of the next one so doing. Therefore, when a young man arose
to depart in the middle of a discourse, he said: &ldquo;Young man, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
you rather go to hell than listen to this sermon?&rdquo; The individual
addressed stopped midway up the aisle and, turning slowly about,

<p>Mr. Seabury and his wife were on the point of moving to another flat.
Both of them were anxious that the transfer should be made at the
least possible expense, and the nearness of the new home promised
materially to further this aim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can carry loads of little things over in my brown bag,&rdquo; announced
Mrs. Seabury. &ldquo;And you can take books and so on in your big satchel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In discussing further the matter of transportation, Mrs. Seabury
remarked that, notwithstanding the heat, she could wear her winter
coat over, and leave it, and return for her spring coat. The idea
charmed her impractical husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I can do the same thing!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear over one suit and
then come back for another!&rdquo;</p>

out he saw a small white foot protruding beyond the opposite curtain.
Reaching across the aisle, he took hold of the large toe and began to

home; this little pig had roast beef; this little pig had none; this
little pig cried wee wee all the way home.&rdquo; The foot was suddenly

the notice immediately after the sermon. The clerk, however, had a

infants. Accordingly, at the close of the sermon he arose and
announced that &ldquo;All those who have children whom they wish to have
baptized please send in their names at once to the clerk.&rdquo; The
clergyman, who was stone deaf, assumed that the clerk was giving out
the hymn-book notice, and immediately rose and said: &ldquo;And I should

harm each other, but they lay themselves open to harm at the hands of
all sorts of other nations. In fact, two nations at war are in the
defenseless and gullible position of a certain English married couple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This couple will fall out and cease to speak to one another for a
year or more at a time. They have a beautiful country house, and there
is a certain elderly matron, a great bore, who visits them
continually. Some one asked this matron which of the pair was always
inviting her. She answered, frankly, &lsquo;Neither invites me ever, but
since they don&rsquo;t speak to each other, each always thinks I am the
other&rsquo;s guest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were talking over the carelessness of well-to-do people who, by
overlooking their small bills, frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> bring disaster upon the
tradesmen who are trying to do business on a small capital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sometimes happens that these poor devils have two or three times
the amount of their capital out in bills that if paid promptly would
make their commercial ways a path of roses,&rdquo; said the economist.
&ldquo;Little bills of three, four, and five dollars, not much in
themselves, mount up high in the aggregate, and it sometimes happens
that a seeming prosperity, through the failure of a lot of customers
to pay their bills within a reasonable time, results in ruin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the reminiscencer, &ldquo;it sometimes works the other way.
I heard a story in England once of a harness dealer who on entering
his shop one afternoon, after an absence of several hours, noticed
that a rather handsome saddle that he had had in stock had
disappeared. He made immediate inquiry of his salesmen, and one of
them informed him that he had sold it to a gentleman who had come to
the shop with his trap, that the purchaser had thrown it into his
wagon and driven off, after telling him to charge it. Unfortunately,
however, he had forgotten to ask the gentleman&rsquo;s name, and all effort
to identify him by description failed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the shopkeeper, who was an ingenious man, &lsquo;there is only
one thing left to be done. We will charge the saddle up on all our
outstanding accounts. Those who did not buy the saddle will, of
course, call our attention to our error, and the man who did take it
will, of course, pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This method was adopted, and at the beginning of the next month the
bills were sent out accordingly. Two weeks later the saddler
approached his cashier,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> and asked if he had heard as yet about the
matter. &lsquo;How about that missing saddle, Marcus?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;We are
doing very well, sir,&rsquo; replied the cashier. &lsquo;Forty of our customers
have paid for it, and only two have discovered the mistake.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story is told of a young Oregon girl, a favorite in society, but
who was poor and had to take care not to get her evening gowns soiled,
as their number was limited. At a dance not long ago a great, big,
red-faced, perspiring man came in and asked her to dance. He wore no
gloves. She looked at the well-meaning moist hands despairingly, and
thought of the immaculate back of her waist. She hesitated a bit, and
then she said, with a winning smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will dance with you, but if you don&rsquo;t mind, won&rsquo;t you
please use your handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked at her blankly a moment or two. Then a light broke over
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>And he pulled out his handkerchief and blew his nose.</p>

<p>Willie finally persuaded his aunt to play train with him. The chairs
were arranged in line and then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you be engineer and I&rsquo;ll be the conductor. Lend me your watch

timepiece in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull out there, you red-headed, pie-faced jay,&rdquo; he shouted to the
astonished young woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Willie,&rdquo; she exclaimed in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, chew the rag,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Pull out. We&rsquo;re five
minutes late already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They have had to forbid his playing down by the tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. Peet, a rather diffident man, was unable to prevent himself from
being introduced one evening to a fascinating young lady, who,
misunderstanding his name, constantly addressed him as Mr. Peters,
much to the gentleman&rsquo;s distress. Finally, summoning courage, he
bashfully but earnestly remonstrated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t call me Peters; call me Peet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I don&rsquo;t know you well enough, Mr. Peters,&rdquo; said the young
lady, blushing as she playfully withdrew behind her fan.</p>

<p>Senator Tillman, of South Carolina, tells of a little girl whose
statements were always exaggerated until she became known in school
and Sunday-school as a &ldquo;little liar.&rdquo; Her parents were dreadfully
worried about her, and made strenuous efforts to correct the bad
habit. One afternoon her mother overheard an argument with her
playmate. Willie Bangs, who seemed to finish the discussion by saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
emphatically: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older than you, &lsquo;cause my birthday comes first, in
May, and yours don&rsquo;t come until September.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course your birthday comes first,&rdquo; sneeringly answered little
Nellie; &ldquo;but that is &lsquo;cause you came down first. I remember looking at
the angels when they were making you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Nellie; come here instantly,&rdquo; cried her mother. &ldquo;It is
breaking mother&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to hear you tell such awful
stories. Remember what happened to Ananias and Sapphira, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, mama, I know. They were struck dead for lying. I saw them
carried into the corner drugstore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relationship between Mr. Gladstone and his wife was one of the
most beautiful the world has known, and of all the millions who looked
up to him, she was his greatest admirer. On one occasion when Mrs.
Gladstone was entertaining visitors, conversation turned on the Bible,
and there was a lively argument on the meaning of a certain passage.</p>

<p>Presently one of the callers, hoping to end the discussion, remarked
devoutly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is One alone who knows all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cloud vanished from Mrs. Gladstone&rsquo;s face and she smiled sunnily
as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and William will be down in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Small Robbie was laboring over a drawing which was obviously of great
importance.</p>

<p>His mother, who was sewing in the room, got up to see what he was
doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you&rsquo;re drawing, dear?&rdquo; she said, as she stood behind him.</p>

<p>Robbie was embarrassed. Struggling to cover his nervousness, he
answered with an air of great nonchalance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s papa I&rsquo;m drawing, but I don&rsquo;t care anything about it. Guess
I&rsquo;ll put a tail to it, and have it for a dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is told of Charles Lamb, that one afternoon, returning from a

<p>One of the ladies-in-waiting to the late Queen Victoria had a very
bright little daughter about four years old of whom the Queen was very
fond.</p>

<p>The Queen invited the child to have lunch with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the mother was highly pleased, and charged the little girl
to be very careful about her table manners, and to be very polite and
careful before the Queen.</p>

<p>The little girl came home in high glee, and the mother asked her all
about the luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you a very polite little girl? and did you remember to do all I
told you at the table?&rdquo; asked the proud mama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I was polite,&rdquo; said the little one, &ldquo;but the Queen wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Why, what did she do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She took her chicken bone up in her fingers, and I just shook my
finger at her like you did at me, and said, &lsquo;Piggy, piggy, piggy!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young girl once asked Mark Twain if he liked books for Christmas
gifts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that depends,&rdquo; drawled the great humorist. &ldquo;If a book has a
leather cover it is really valuable as a razor strop. If it is a
brief, concise work, such as the French write, it is useful to put
under the short leg of a wabbly table. An old-fashioned book with a
clasp can&rsquo;t be beat as a missile to hurl at a dog, and a large book
like a geography is as good as a piece of tin to nail over a broken
pane of glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most candid tributes the late Edwin Booth ever received was
rendered to him on his last Southern tour by one who knew neither of
his presence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> nor of his identity in the play. Mr. Booth told the
story to his friend, Dr. John H. Girdner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We opened our engagement in Atlanta, Ga., with &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr.
Booth, &ldquo;and I played Othello. After the performance my friend, Mr.
Malone, and I went to the Kimball House for some refreshment. The long
bar was so crowded that we had to go around the corner of it before we
could find a vacant space. While we were waiting to be served we
couldn&rsquo;t help hearing the conversation of two fine-looking old boys,
splendid old fellows with soft hats, flowing mustaches, and chin
tufts, black string ties and all the other paraphernalia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you at the theater this evening, Cunnel,&rsquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy seats till this mawnin&rsquo;, and
the best we could get were six rows back in the balcony. I presume,
suh, you were in the orchestra.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Cunnel, I was in the orchestra,&rsquo; said the first man. &lsquo;Madam and
the girls were with me. We all agreed that we nevuh attended a mo&rsquo;

<p>A Southern colonel had a colored valet by the name of George. George
received nearly all of the colonel&rsquo;s cast-off clothing. He had his
eyes on a certain pair of light trousers which were not wearing out
fast enough to suit him, so he thought he would hasten matters
somewhat by rubbing grease on one knee.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> When the colonel saw the
spot, he called George and asked if he had noticed it. George said,
&ldquo;Yes, sah, Colonel, I noticed dat spot and tried mighty hard to git it
out, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried gasoline?&rdquo; the colonel asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah, Colonel, but it didn&rsquo;t do no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried brown paper and a hot iron?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah, Colonel, I&rsquo;se done tried &rsquo;mos&rsquo; everything I knows of, but
dat spot wouldn&rsquo;t come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, George, have you tried ammonia?&rdquo; the colonel asked as a last
resort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sah, Colonel, I ain&rsquo;t tried &rsquo;em on yet, but I knows dey&rsquo;ll fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first vaudeville performance the old colored lady had ever
seen, and she was particularly excited over the marvelous feats of the
magician. But when he covered a newspaper with a heavy flannel cloth
and read the print through it, she grew a little nervous. He then
doubled the cloth and again read the letters accurately.</p>

<p>This was more than she could stand, and rising in her seat, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home. This ain&rsquo;t no place for a lady in a thin calico

<p>A pompous Bishop of Oxford was once stopped on a London street by a
ragged urchin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my little man, what can I do for you?&rdquo; inquired the churchman.
&ldquo;The time o&rsquo; day, please, your lordship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With considerable difficulty the portly Bishop extracted his watch.
&ldquo;It is exactly half-past five, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the boy, setting his feet for a good start, &ldquo;at &rsquo;alf-past
six you go to &rsquo;ell!&rdquo; and he was off like a flash and around the
corner. The Bishop, flushed and furious, his watch dangling from its
chain, floundered wildly after him. But as he rounded the corner he
ran plump into the outstretched arms of the venerable Bishop of
London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oxford, Oxford,&rdquo; remonstrated that surprised dignitary, &ldquo;why this
unseemly haste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puffing, blowing, spluttering, the outraged Bishop gasped out: &ldquo;That
young ragamuffin&mdash;I told him it was half-past five&mdash;and&mdash;he&mdash;er&mdash;told
me to go to hell at half-past six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Bishop of London with a twinkle in his kindly old
eyes, &ldquo;but why such haste? You&rsquo;ve got almost an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lady entered a railway station not a hundred miles from Edinburgh

<p>&ldquo;Single?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t any of your business,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I might have been

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep the visitors from coming up,&rdquo; said the office-boy

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;just tell them that&rsquo;s what they all say. I
don&rsquo;t care if you &lsquo;cheek&rsquo; them, but I must have quietness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must see him!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weedon Grossmith used to tell a good story about a play by Mr.
Robert Ganthony, which that gentleman asked him to read. Mr. Grossmith
took the comedy, but lost it on his way home. &ldquo;Night after night,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I would meet Ganthony and he would ask me how I liked his play.
It was awful; the perspiration used to come out on my forehead as I&rsquo;d
say sometimes, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to look at it yet!&rsquo; or again, &lsquo;The
first act was good, but I can&rsquo;t stop to explain,&rsquo; etc., &lsquo;must catch a
train.&rsquo; That play was the bane of my existence, and haunted me even in
my dreams.&rdquo; Some months passed, and Ganthony, a merry wag, still
pursued him without mercy. At last it occurred to Mr. Grossmith that
he might have left the comedy in the cab on the night it was given to
him. He inquired at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Play marked with Mr. Ganthony&rsquo;s name, sent
back to owner four months ago, as soon as found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was something of a scoffer at religious ceremonies, although he

At last he was successful. Jerry grudgingly consented to go to church
Easter Sunday because of the importance of the occasion.</p>

<p>The two sat together, Jerry an interested spectator, while Mike

<p>As a couple of callers were in the parlor of a friend who is a firm

<p>One of the visitors was a rather grim great-aunt of the family who

any. The chist contains the lungs and a piece of the liver. The
stummick is devoted to the bowels, of which there are five, a, e, i,

mother&rsquo;s eyes, her own eyes shining like stars, and said, &ldquo;I did ask
him, mama, dearest, and he said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Miss Polly; that
big yellow dog has often fooled me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;Boohoo! Boohoo!&rdquo; wailed little Johnny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, dear?&rdquo; his mother asked comfortingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boohoo&mdash;er&mdash;p-picture fell on papa&rsquo;s toes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, that&rsquo;s too bad, but you mustn&rsquo;t cry about it, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two candidates for office in Missouri were stumping the northern part
of the State. In one town their appearance was almost simultaneous.
The candidate last arriving stopped at a house for a drink of water.
To the little girl who answered his knock at the door he said&mdash;when
she had given him the desired drink and he had offered her some candy
in recompense:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the man ahead of me give you anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;He gave me candy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the candidate. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s five cents for you. I don&rsquo;t
suppose that <i>he</i> gave you any money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youngster laughed. &ldquo;Yes, he did, too! He gave me ten cents!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to be outdone, the candidate gave the little one another nickel
and picking her up in his arms, kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he kiss you, too?&rdquo; he asked genially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did, sir,&rdquo; responded the little girl, &ldquo;and he kissed ma,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owner of a dry-goods store heard a new clerk say to a customer,
&ldquo;No, madam, we have not had any for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a fierce glance at the clerk the smart employer rushed up to the
woman and said: &ldquo;We have plenty of everything in reserve ma&rsquo;am; plenty
upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The customer and the clerk looked dazed. Then the proprietor, seeing
that something was wrong, said to the customer: &ldquo;Excuse me, what did
you ask for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman simply replied, &ldquo;Why, I said to your clerk that we hadn&rsquo;t
had any rain lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senator W. A. Clark detests nothing more than to be interrupted when
busy. One day he was in his office engaged in a business conversation
when a petite woman, carrying a black bag, entered. With a compelling
smile and an insinuating manner she approached the surly millionaire.
Utterly insensible to his repellent mood and indifferent to his abrupt
manner she drew from the depths of a bag a handsomely bound volume,
the merits and beauty of which she began eloquently to descant upon.</p>

<p>Failing to embarrass her with arctic frigidity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> impatient at her
persistency under rebuffs all but vulgar, he turned suddenly upon the
chattering woman and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, do you know what my time is worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She confessed it was a conundrum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, petulantly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth $30 an hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned away with the air of one who had settled the matter
definitely beyond any further controversy. But he didn&rsquo;t know the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so grateful to you, Mr. Clark,&rdquo; she replied, with a tone of
pathos in her voice. &ldquo;Thirty dollars an hour, did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s what I said, and it&rsquo;s cheap at that,&rdquo; and he smiled
cynically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it&rsquo;s dirt cheap,&rdquo; she chirped with winsome blitheness. &ldquo;I
am so glad you told me&rdquo;&mdash;rummaging in her reticule, from which she
quickly flashed out a purse gorged with currency. Moving near to the
astonished millionaire, who now regarded her movements with unfeigned
curiosity, she counted two bills, a ten and a five, off the roll.
These she pushed along the top of the sloping desk toward him and
said: &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m glad you told me, because I hadn&rsquo;t expected to get it
so cheap. There is $15. Now, I want a half hour of your uninterrupted
attention while I talk to you about this book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clark pushed the money back and subscribed and paid for two copies of
the book.</p>

<p>A New Yorker who does his bit of &ldquo;globe trotting&rdquo; tells of two odd
entries that he saw in the visitors&rsquo; book of a fashionable resort on
the Rhine.</p>

<p>A few years ago one of the Paris members of the Rothschild family had
registered as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;R. de Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>It chanced that the next visitor to inscribe his name in the book was
Baron Oppenheim, the banker of Cologne, and he wrote beneath
Rothschild&rsquo;s:</p>

<p>&ldquo;O. de Cologne.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>The Stranger&mdash;&ldquo;And who are the Murphys&rsquo; ancestors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a wedding-feast recently the bridegroom was called upon, as usual,
to respond to the given toast, in spite of the fact that he had
previously pleaded to be excused. Blushing to the roots of his hair,
he rose to his feet. He intended to imply that he was unprepared for
speechmaking, but he unfortunately placed his hand upon his bride&rsquo;s
shoulder, and looked down at her as he stammered out his opening and
concluding words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This&mdash;er&mdash;thing has been forced upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>Very much excited and out of breath, a young man who could not have
been married very long rushed up to an attendant at one of the city
hospitals and inquired after Mrs. Brown, explaining between breaths
that it was his wife whom he felt anxious about.</p>

<p>The attendant looked at the register and replied that there was no
Mrs. Brown in the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! Don&rsquo;t keep me waiting in this manner,&rdquo; said the excited young
man. &ldquo;I must know how she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; again said the attendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be,&rdquo; broke in the visitor, &ldquo;for here is a note I found on
the kitchen-table when I came home from work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The note read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dear Jack</i>&mdash;Have gone to have my kimono cut out.   <span class="smcap">Annie.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dear old New England spinster, the embodiment of the timid and
shrinking, passed away at Carlsbad, where she had gone for her health.
Her nearest kinsman, a nephew, ordered her body sent back to be
buried&mdash;as was her last wish&mdash;in the quiet little country churchyard.
His surprise can be imagined, when on opening the casket, he beheld,
instead of the placid features of his aunt Mary, the majestic port of
an English General in full regimentals, whom he remembered had chanced
to die at the same time and place as his aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>At once he cabled to the General&rsquo;s heirs explaining the situation and
requesting instructions.</p>

<p>They came back as follows: &ldquo;Give the General quiet funeral. Aunt Mary
interred to-day with full military honors, six brass bands, saluting
guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the morning session, when the pupils were feeling bright and
happy, the teacher thought it a good plan to give them sentences to
correct, both as to grammar and sense. She accordingly wrote on the
blackboard: &ldquo;The hen has four legs. He done it.&rdquo; Thoughtful little
Ignatius, at the foot of the class, pondered deeply, and at the end of
the fifteen minutes&rsquo; time allowed for correction he wrote: &ldquo;<i>He</i>
didn&rsquo;t done it: God done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The late John Stetson, famous in his day as a theatrical manager, was
having a yacht built, and a friend, meeting him on the street, asked
him what he was going to name the boat. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided yet,&rdquo;
replied John, &ldquo;but it will be some name commencing with S, probably
either &lsquo;Psyche&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cinch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clergyman was on board a steamer which was caught in a severe gale.
The rolling was constant and seemed to get worse as time went on. At
last the good man got thoroughly frightened. He believed they were
destined for a watery grave, so he went to the captain and asked if he
might have prayers. The captain took him by the arm and led him to the
forecastle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> where the tars were singing and swearing. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;when you hear the men swearing you may know there is no danger.&rdquo;
The clergyman went back feeling better, but still the storm increased
and his alarm also. Disconsolate, he managed to stagger to the
forecastle again, where he heard the sailors swearing as hard as ever.
&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said to his sympathetic wife as he crawled back to his
berth, &ldquo;Mary, thank God, they&rsquo;re swearing yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawaiian servants,&rdquo; said a woman with some experience of them, &ldquo;are
the best in the world, but they are strangely unsophisticated,
strangely naive. They insist on calling you by your first name. Ours
were always saying to my husband, &lsquo;Yes, John,&rsquo; or &lsquo;all right, John,&rsquo;
and to me &lsquo;very well, Ann,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ann, I am going out.&rsquo; At last I got
tired of this and to John, when we got a new cook, I said: Don&rsquo;t ever
call me by my first name in the cook&rsquo;s presence. Then, perhaps, not
knowing my name, he&rsquo;ll have to say &lsquo;Mrs.&rsquo; to me. So John was careful
to address me as &lsquo;dearie,&rsquo; or &lsquo;sweetheart,&rsquo; the watchful chap gave me
no title at all. One day we had some English officers to dine. I told
them how I had overcome, in my new cook&rsquo;s case, the native servants&rsquo;
abuse of their employer&rsquo;s Christian names, and I said, By this
servant, at least, you won&rsquo;t hear me called &lsquo;Ann.&rsquo;&rdquo; Just then the new
cook entered the room. He bowed to me respectfully and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sweetheart, dinner is served!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What?&rsquo; I stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dinner is served, dearie!&rsquo; answered the cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early one morning, on the second day out, a terribly seasick
passenger, pale and hollow-eyed, came out of his stateroom and ran
into a lady, who was coming along the passageway, clad in the

<p>Mike and Pat worked for a wealthy farmer. They planned to turn
burglars and steal the money which the farmer had hid in one of the
rooms of his house. They waited until midnight, then started to do the
job.</p>

<p>In order to get the money they had to pass the farmer&rsquo;s bedroom. Mike
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first, and if it&rsquo;s all right you can follow and do just
the same as I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike started to pass the room. Just as he got opposite the door the
floor creaked. This awoke the farmer, who called out, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike answered with a &ldquo;meaow!&rdquo; (imitating a cat). The farmer&rsquo;s wife
being awake, too, said, &ldquo;Oh, John, it&rsquo;s the cat,&rdquo; and all was quiet.</p>

<p>Now Pat started to pass the door, and as he got opposite it the floor
creaked again. The farmer called out again, louder than before, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pat answered, &ldquo;Another cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were on their honeymoon. He had bought a catboat and had taken
her out to show her how well he could handle a boat, putting her to
tend the sheet. A puff of wind came, and he shouted in no uncertain
tones, &ldquo;Let go the sheet.&rdquo; No response. Then again, &ldquo;Let go that
sheet, quick.&rdquo; Still no movement. A few minutes later, when both were
clinging to the bottom of the overturned boat, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let go that sheet when I told you to, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have,&rdquo; said the bride, &ldquo;if you had not been so rough about
it. You ought to speak more kindly to your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few men have ever been so ready and witty as Mark Twain in introducing
others to public audiences. At Hartford, December 12, 1877, he

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &rsquo;am, son. Say <i>&rsquo;am</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did say &rsquo;am,&rdquo; the lad protested in an injured tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never ask a woman to mend anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been

suggestions. When I want a shirt mended I take it to my wife, flourish
it around a little and say, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s that rag-bag?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want of the rag-bag?&rsquo; asks my wife. Her suspicions are

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to throw this shirt away; it&rsquo;s worn out,&rsquo; I say, with a few

<p>A right reverend prelate, himself a man of extreme good-nature, was
frequently much vexed in spirit by the proud, froward, perverse, and
untractable temper of his next vicar. The latter, after an absence
much longer than usual, one day paid a visit to the bishop, who kindly
inquired the cause of his absence, and was answered by the vicar that
he had been confined to his house for some time past by an obstinate

and we invited three other girls, Mayme and Carrye Miller and Edyth
Kent. I hope you are all well at home. I can&rsquo;t write any more now for
I have a lot of studying to do. With lots of love to all.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;Your affectionate daughter,</span><br />

<p>To this she received the following reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My dear Daughter Alyss</i>&mdash;I was glad to receive your letter and to
know that you are enjoying yourself. Uncle Jaymes came the other day,
bringing Charls and Albyrt with him. Your brother Henrie was
delighted, for he has been lonely without you. I have bought a new
gray horse whose name is Byllye. He matches nicely with old Fredde.
With much love from us all, I am,</p>

<p>While Chauncey M. Depew was at the Omaha Exposition, he and President
Callaway of the New York Central chanced to go into a booth on the
Midway Plaisance.</p>

<p>It was a tame entertainment and there was only a meager attendance
when Mr. Depew and Mr. Callaway entered. Their stay would have been
very brief except for the fact that they had scarcely taken their
seats before there began a steady inpouring of people, which continued
until the small auditorium was crowded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking this extraordinary increase of spectators as an indication that
something of an interesting nature was about to be disclosed, the two
New Yorkers concluded to sit it out. Half an hour&rsquo;s waiting failed to
reward their patient expectancy, however, and Mr. Callaway suggested
that they move on.</p>

<p>Just then ex-Secretary of Agriculture J. Sterling Morton pushed his
way through the crowd, and, extending his hand to Mr. Depew,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Doctor Depew, so you are really here! I thought that &lsquo;barker&rsquo;
was lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Depew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the &lsquo;barker&rsquo; for this show is standing outside and inviting the
crowd to &lsquo;step up lively&rsquo; and pay ten cents for the privilege of
seeing the &lsquo;great and only Chauncey M. Depew.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That the royal road to learning is full of strange pitfalls is shown
by some of the definitions and statements given by
school-children&mdash;some of whom are well along the way. The following
are <i>bona fide</i> samples coming under the knowledge of one teacher:</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this time Columbus was cursing around among the West Indies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s campaign in the Valley was the greatest piece of
millinery-work ever known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Valkyrie were the Choosers of the Slain, and the Valhalla the
Haulers of the Slain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eldest son of the King of France is called The Dolphin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Clarence, according to his usual custom, was killed in
battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A certain curate in the course of conversation at a dinner party some
time ago remarked to a friend, &ldquo;I had a curious dream last night, but
as it was about my vicar I hardly like to tell it.&rdquo; On being pressed,
however, he began: &ldquo;I dreamt I was dead and was on my way to Heaven,
which was reached by a very long ladder. At the foot I was met by an
angel, who pressed a piece of chalk into my hand and said, &lsquo;If you
climb long enough you will reach Heaven, but for every sin you are
conscious of having committed you must mark a rung of the ladder with
the chalk as you go up.&rsquo; I took the chalk and started. I had climbed
up very, very far and was feeling very tired when I suddenly met my
vicar coming down. &lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what are you going down for?&rsquo;
&lsquo;More chalk.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. McKinley used to tell of a colored widow whose children she had
helped educate. The widow, rather late in life, married.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on?&rdquo; Mrs. McKinley asked her a few months after
her marriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, thank yo&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the bride answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is your husband a good provider?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed he am a good providah, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was the enthusiastic reply.
&ldquo;Why, jes&rsquo; dis las&rsquo; week he got me five new places to wash at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A certain curate was of a painfully nervous temperament, and in
consequence was constantly making awkward remarks&mdash;intended as
compliments&mdash;to the bishop and others. Having distinguished himself in
an unusual degree during a gathering of clergy to an afternoon tea at
the bishop&rsquo;s palace, he was taken to task for his failings by a senior
curate, who was one of his companions on the way home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Bruce,&rdquo; said the senior decidedly, &ldquo;you are a donkey! Why
can not you keep quiet, instead of making your asinine remarks? I am
speaking to you now as a brother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud laughter interrupted him at this point, and for the moment he
wondered why.</p>

<p>An earnest clergyman one Sunday morning was exhorting those who had
anxious and troubled consciences to be sure and call on their pastor
for guidance and prayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To show you, my brethren, the blessed results of these visits with
your pastor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will state to you that only yesterday a
gentleman of wealth called upon me for counsel and instruction; and
now to-day, my friends&mdash;to-day he sits among us, not only a Christian,
but a happy husband and father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young lady in the audience whispered to a matron: &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that
pretty quick work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A good story is told of the late George Augustus Sala in his early and
impecunious days. At some festive gathering where Mr. Sala was
present, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> Attemborough, the famous pawnbroker, was also a guest.
They recognized each other, and shook hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Attemborough,&rdquo; said the journalist. &ldquo;We have met
often before, but I think this is the first time I have ever seen your

<p>A clergyman in the West Country had two curates, one a comparatively
old man, the other very young. With the former he had not been able to
work agreeably; and on being invited to another living, he accepted
it, and took the young curate with him. Naturally, there was a
farewell sermon; and we can imagine the feelings of the curate who was
to be left behind when he heard the text given out, &ldquo;Abide ye here
with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bishop was staying with a friend in a country house. On Sunday
morning as he passed through the library he found a small boy curled
up in a big chair, deeply interested in a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to church, Tom?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I am,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to go. It&rsquo;s your job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A celebrated continental specialist to whom time was literally money
and who was possessed of a fiery temper made it a rule that all
patients should undress before entering his consulting room so as not
to waste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> any of his valuable time. One day a meek-looking little man
entered with all his clothes on. &ldquo;What do you mean by coming in like
that?&rdquo; said the doctor in a rage. &ldquo;Go and strip at once!&rdquo; &ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo;
faltered the man. &ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ve no time to waste,&rdquo; yelled the
doctor, and the poor man left the room in haste. When his turn came he
reentered the room. &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s better. What
can I do for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I called to collect your subscription for the
benevolent society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tall man, impatiently pacing the platform of a wayside station,
accosted a red-haired boy of about twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-s-say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;d-d-do y-you know ha-ha-how late this train is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy grinned but made no reply. The man stuttered out something
about red-headed kids in general and passed into the station.</p>

<p>A stranger, overhearing the one-sided conversation, asked the boy why
he hadn&rsquo;t answered the big man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D-d-d&rsquo;ye wanter see me g-g-get me fa-fa-face punched?&rdquo; stammered the

ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, George, but I didn&rsquo;t quite catch your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> friend&rsquo;s name.

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Specknoodle!</span>&rdquo; George fairly yelled.</p>

<p>Former Congressman Fred Landis of Indiana has made a reputation for
himself as an orator. A year or so ago Landis, speaking at the
unveiling of a monument to President Lincoln, uttered the phrase,
&ldquo;Abraham Lincoln&mdash;that mystic mingling of star and clod.&rdquo; This was
loudly applauded. After the speech a friend of Landis approached him,
and, repeating the phrase, said: &ldquo;Fred, what in the name of heaven
does that mean?&rdquo; Putting his arm around his friend&rsquo;s shoulder, Landis
replied: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, really, but it gets &rsquo;em every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later the steamer was diving under the waves as if she

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope it has not come to that,&rdquo; gasped the Bishop.</p>

<p>A couple of New Yorkers were playing golf on a New Jersey course on
Election Day when they saw a fine-appearing old gentleman looking at
them wistfully. They asked him to join the game, which he did with
alacrity. He was mild in speech and manner and played well. But once
when he had made a foozle he ejaculated vehemently the word: &ldquo;Croton!&rdquo;
A few minutes later when he made another bad play, he repeated:
&ldquo;Croton!&rdquo; The third time he said it, one of his new-made friends said:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be inquisitive, but will you tell me why you say
&lsquo;Croton&rsquo; so often?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that the

<p>A tall young man stalked with stately stride into the office of a
small hotel in a remote part of the White Mountains. Behind him came a
severe valet carrying bags and a gun-case, and on a wagon at the door
were two prosperous trunks. In an armchair behind the hotel counter
sat a spare old man placidly chewing tobacco and reading the &ldquo;Weekly
Recorder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h! Hm!&rdquo; the tall young man began. &ldquo;Is this Mr. Silas P. Meacham,
proprietor of this hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yaas,&rdquo; replied the old one, glancing up over his paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Hanningford Wattster van Derventer, of the Metropolis Club,

&ldquo;What is that circle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the well,&rdquo; Mamie replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; answered the child, &ldquo;is the oaken bucket, one is the iron-bound
bucket, and the other is the moss-covered bucket that hung in the
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mamie, what are all these little dots for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we take a kind of municipal pride in seeing which
city can show the greatest number of lynchings yearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do tell us about a lynching you have seen yourself,&rdquo; broke in

<p>&ldquo;The night before I sailed for England,&rdquo; said Eugene Field, &ldquo;I was
giving a dinner at a hotel to a party of intimate friends when a
colored waiter spilled a plate of soup over the gown of a lady at an
adjoining table. The gown was utterly ruined, and the gentlemen of her
party at once seized the waiter, tied a rope around his neck, and at a
signal from the injured lady swung him into the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible,&rdquo; said the hostess with a shudder. &ldquo;And did you actually see
this yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; admitted the American apologetically. &ldquo;Just at that moment
I happened to be downstairs killing the chef for putting mustard in
the blanc mange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones recently spent a few days at a farm, and in a moment of
originality bought some poultry from the farmer with a view to their
providing fresh eggs for breakfast every morning. She sent them to
town per the local carrier, despatching a note at the same time to her
husband telling him to look out for the consignment. When Jones
reached home from his office he inquired if the poultry had arrived.
The servant told him they had, but the man had carelessly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> put them in
the back yard, leaving the door open, and they had all escaped.
Thereupon a fowl hunt was immediately organized. The next day Jones
saw the carrier. &ldquo;Nice trick you played me yesterday,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;spent
three hours hunting those fowls and only found ten.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then think
yourself blessed lucky,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;I only brought six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A patronizing young lord was seated opposite the late James McNeill
Whistler at dinner one evening. During a lull in the conversation he

<p>The new minister in a Georgia church was delivering his first sermon.
The darky janitor was a critical listener from a back corner of the
church. The minister&rsquo;s sermon was eloquent, and his prayers seemed to
cover the whole category of human wants.</p>

<p>After the services one of the deacons asked the old darky what he
thought of the new minister. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he offers up a good
prayer, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah mos&rsquo; suhtainly does, boss. Why, dat man axed de good Lord fo&rsquo;

<p>For weeks the kindergarten had been deluged with nature verses, and
the process of absorption was far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> advanced. Sufficiently to admit of
a little squeezing with results, thought the teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you each to bring in a little verse
that you have made yourselves about the buds, or the trees, or the
flowers, or anything that pleases you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Various specimens were produced next day, but the gem of the

<p>A story about King Edward is worth repeating. Just before the illness
which caused the postponement of the coronation, he was racing down
one of the country roads in his motor-car at a speed which was away
beyond the legal limit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! Hi!&rdquo; called a policeman. &ldquo;Stop there, in the name of the law!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herbert S. Stone, the publisher, described at a dinner in Washington
the amusing methods of a newspaper writer who used to write articles
at a set rate a column.</p>

<p>He was once commissioned to do a serial story for a Chicago paper. The
story, as it proceeded from week to week, was interesting, but it
contained many passages like the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he lives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor, sending for the man, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hereafter we will pay you by the letters in your serial. We will pay
you so much a thousand letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man, looking crestfallen, went away, but in the very next
instalment of his story he introduced a character who stuttered, and
all through the chapter were scattered passages like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-b-b-b-believe me, s-s-s-sir, I am n-n-not g-g-g-guilty. M-m-m-my

<p>A man with a soft, low voice had just completed his purchases in a

<p>&ldquo;No; rub out the O and let the K stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk looked annoyed. &ldquo;Will you please give me your initials

<p>&ldquo;I said K.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, you said O. K. Perhaps you had better write it
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;Oh&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just now you said K.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to finish what I started to say. I said &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; because I did
not understand what you were asking me. I did not mean that it was my
initial. My name is Kirby Jepson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not O., but K.,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Give me the pencil, and I&rsquo;ll
write it down for you myself. There, I guess it&rsquo;s O. K. now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The furnishing of the new house had gone on vociferously. All the
family told stories of the beautiful and rare articles picked up at
auctions, usually at such bargains as only amateurs in such matters
are able to find. There was naturally much curiosity to see how the
house looked. The first visitor who had the opportunity to inspect it
was eagerly questioned by her friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t describe it myself,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;All I can say is that

Dodge was visiting the farm some time later, and, happening to think

<p>A short time ago a lady with an only child (aged seven) was
entertaining the bishop of the diocese to afternoon tea. The small
girl was allowed to come to tea, but her mother had instilled into her
mind the necessity of speaking reverently to the bishop. Tea came and
with it the pangs of hunger, but at the same time her mother&rsquo;s
warning, &ldquo;speak reverently,&rdquo; was always before her. After sitting for
about ten minutes gazing at the good things and repeating over and
over again, &ldquo;speak reverently,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake pass me

<p>Hiram Hardscrabble and his load of hay, two horses, and a perfectly
good wagon were pitched so high and so far by a reckless railroad
train that when they came down they weren&rsquo;t&mdash;any of &rsquo;em&mdash;good for
much. The local Congressman took the case, and after some months
advised Hiram to accept the railroad company&rsquo;s offer of lifelong
employment at $15 a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> week. Hiram accepted. They put him out as a
flagman on a crossing near his native village.</p>

<p>Cassidy, the section boss, stopped his handcar before the flag-shanty,
and after a searching look at Hiram advised as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the new flagman, are ye? And ye&rsquo;ve niver railroaded before.
No harm. We&rsquo;ll make a man iv ye. See, now, there&rsquo;s yer red flag and
yer green flag and yer white flag, and yer thrain schedule within on
the wall. All ye have to do is dhrop the gates befoor the thrains do
come, so that they&rsquo;ll have a clear thrack. D&rsquo;ye mind, now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s wan thing above all others&mdash;th&rsquo; Impire Shtate Express!
Putt yer gates down two minyits before she comes and keep them down
till she&rsquo;s pasht. Mind now, she must niver be late on this section.
Niver wan minyit late. I won&rsquo;t sthand f&rsquo;r it. Remimber&mdash;th&rsquo; Impire
Shtate Express. She must niver be late here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiram promised. At 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when the Empire State Express was due in
two minutes, he dropped the crossing gates and stood by with the white
flag to wave her along. Three minutes passed, four, five&mdash;and still no
train. As a matter of fact, she had lost half an hour at an open draw
on the Harlem River in the morning, and was laboring mightily to
regain lost time in spite of her fast schedule.</p>

<p>Seven minutes late, and then Hiram heard a wild shriek a mile away and
saw the express coming. He darted into the shanty, grabbed a red flag,
and leaped out upon the track, waving it furiously. The engineer shut
off, threw over the reverse lever, gave her sand and the air; and the
mighty train stopped short, in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> whirl of sand, cinders, and sparks,
brakes creaking and passengers pitchpoling everywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; roared the engineer, thrusting half his body
out of the cab and glaring down at Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be yeou th&rsquo; ingineer?&rdquo; asked the flagman, peering at him with
suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! Whad-do-you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want t&rsquo; know whut&rsquo;s made ye so goldinged late? Cassidy says he
wun&rsquo;t stand f&rsquo;r it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I called out &lsquo;fore&rsquo; as loudly as I could,&rdquo; explained the golfer.</p>

<p>Mark Twain observed once at a public dinner that he had written a
friendly letter to Queen Victoria protesting against a tax being
levied in England on his head, on the ground that it was a gas-works.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve met your son. He was at the
head of a procession in the Strand, and I was on a &rsquo;bus.&rdquo; Years
afterward he met the King at Homburg, and they had a long talk. At
parting the King said: &ldquo;I am glad to have met you again.&rdquo; That last
word troubled Mark, who asked whether the King had not mistaken him
for some one else. The reply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&mdash;&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember meeting me in
the Strand when I was at the head of a procession and you were on a

<p>The jam manufacturer one day wrote Mr. James an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> impudent letter,

one. On arriving he found the farmer repairing his fence.</p>

<p>The whole thing was new to a French literary man, who politely asked
the guest on his right, &ldquo;Why does he walk up and down when he does
this thing? Does it add to the volume of the sound, or does it make a
cadence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that. I fancy it&rsquo;s to

<p>Some time ago Professor Brander Matthews went to dine at a certain
dramatic club in New York. Going to the club letter box he picked up
and perused a letter which seemed to be addressed to him. It was a
request from a tailor for the settlement of his little bill. As the
man&rsquo;s name was quite strange to him he made a careful examination, and
finding that he had been mistaken, put the missive back into its
place. Immediately afterward he saw the real owner take possession of
it, walk into the reading-room, read it carefully, and tear it into
shreds. Then, assured of an audience, the man whose clothes were still
unpaid for, assumed the weary smile of an accomplished ladykiller and
remarked audibly, &ldquo;Poor, silly, little girl!&rdquo;</p>

returning home, the Irishman saw him to the station, and they went
together to have a last cigar.</p>

stately manner, nevertheless had a way of bearing down the foe with
almost savage wit. Once, in court, he had to follow a barrister who
had delivered his remarks in very loud tones. &ldquo;Now that the noise in
court has subsided,&rdquo; murmured Bethell, &ldquo;I will tell your Honor in two
sentences the gist of the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The resemblance of the Rev. Robert Collyer to Henry Ward Beecher was
often remarked. One day, when walking through Central Park, hat in
hand, as the day was hot, at a sharp turn in the path he came upon an
old lady seated on one of the park benches. At sight of him she jumped
to her feet, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness me! This is not Mr. Beecher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; Dr. Collyer answered, &ldquo;it is not. I hope Mr. Beecher is
in a cooler place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not necessary that a lawyer should be eloquent to win verdicts,
but he must have the tact which turns an apparent defeat to his own
advantage. One of the most successful of verdict winners was Sir James
Scarlett. His skill in turning a failure into a success was wonderful.
In a breach-of-promise case the defendant, Scarlett&rsquo;s client, was
alleged to have been cajoled into an engagement by the plaintiff&rsquo;s
mother.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> She was a witness in behalf of her daughter, and completely
baffled Scarlett, who cross-examined her. But in his argument he
exhibited his tact by this happy stroke of advocacy: &ldquo;You saw,
gentlemen of the jury, that I was but a child in her hands. What must
my client have been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a young man&mdash;a candidate for an agricultural constituency&mdash;and
he was sketching in glowing colors to an audience of rural voters the
happy life the laborer would lead under an administration for the
propagation of sweetness and light. &ldquo;We have not yet three acres and a
cow, but it will come. Old-age pensions are still of the future, but
they will come.&rdquo; Similarly every item of his comprehensive program was
endorsed by the same parrot cry. Then he went on to talk of prison
reforms. &ldquo;I have not yet personally,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;been inside a criminal
lunatic asylum.&rdquo; Then there was a voice from the back of the hall,
&ldquo;But it will come.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>The judge had had his patience sorely tried by lawyers who wished to
talk and by men who wished to evade jury service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shudge!&rdquo; cried a little German in the jury box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I t&rsquo;ink I like to go home to my wife,&rdquo; said the German.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the judge. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, shudge,&rdquo; persisted the German, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink I make a good
shuror.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best in the box,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What box?&rdquo; said the German.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jury box,&rdquo; said the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, shudge,&rdquo; persisted the little German, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak good
English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to speak any at all,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little German pointed at the lawyers to make his last desperate
plea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shudge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make noddings of what these fellers say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the judge&rsquo;s chance to get even for many annoyances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither can any one else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A parson, diminutive in size and his head covered with hair of the
most fiery hue, officiated one Sunday for a friend in a colliery
village near Nottingham. The old-fashioned pulpit had a high desk over
which the parson&rsquo;s red head was hardly visible. This was too much for
a burly collier seated immediately under the pulpit, who when he heard
the text, &ldquo;I am the Light of the World,&rdquo; exclaimed to the clerk, &ldquo;Push
him up a bit higher, mate; don&rsquo;t let him burn in the socket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From a French journal comes this little anecdote of a tutor and his

<p>The lesson was in Roman history, and the prince was unprepared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We come now to the Emperor Caligula. What do you know about him,
prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question was followed by a silence that was becoming awkward when
it was broken by the diplomatic tutor. &ldquo;Your highness is right,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;perfectly right. The less said about this emperor the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An error for which nervousness may have been responsible was that made
by the boy who was told to take the Bishop&rsquo;s shaving water to him one
morning and cautioned to answer the Bishop&rsquo;s inquiry &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; by
saying, &ldquo;The boy, my Lord.&rdquo; Whether from nervousness or not, the boy
managed to transpose the words of this sentence with ludicrous effect,
and the Bishop was surprised and perhaps alarmed to hear in response
to his inquiry the answer, &ldquo;The Lord, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>President Eliot of Harvard recently visited a hotel in New York, and
when he left the dining-room the colored man in charge of the hats
picked up his tile without hesitation and handed it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know that was my hat when you have a hundred there?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Eliot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it, sah,&rdquo; said the negro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know it was mine? Then why did you give it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you gave it to me, sah.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;How small have you felt?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have felt as small as a man in the presence of

<p>&ldquo;I have felt as small as the Prohibition nominee for Vice-President.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head again sadly.</p>

<p>In one of the Atlanta Sunday-schools recently the lesson for the day
had to do with Mammon and the corrupting influences of great riches.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the exercises the superintendent called upon the
infant class to repeat the Golden Text, which had special reference to
man&rsquo;s inability to serve his Creator and the money-god at one and the
same time. The class failed to respond as it should, when the
superintendent, noticing his own young hopeful in the ranks, who had
that very morning been drilled thoroughly on the text, called on him.
The response was immediate, though a slight departure from the
original, for in a voice that was distinctly heard in all parts of the
room there came the following modification:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye can not serve God and mama!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;Any complaints, corporal?&rdquo; said the colonel, making one morning a

<p>&ldquo;My men, I am fully aware of the fact that many of you brave fellows

<p>Once upon a time there was a young married man who had some slight
bickerings with the woman of his choice. These having occurred with
great frequency, he went to his father, who was older and much more
married.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is it not meet that I should be the ringmaster in
my own wickiup? Or must I kowtow to the old lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat the old man smiled wisely and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, yonder are a hundred chickens and here a fine team of horses.
Do you place the feathered tribe on this wagon, hitch up the team, and
start out. Wherever you find a man and his wife living together, make
diligent investigation to find out who the commanding officer is, and
where it is the woman give her a chicken. If you find a man running a
house give him one of the horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the young man loaded up the fowls and started out upon his
pilgrimage of self-education. And when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> he had but seven chickens
left, he approached a habitation with his forlorn inquiry, to which
the man replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the ace-high cockalorum of this outfit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the wife, without fear or favor, corroborated the statement. Then
the young man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your choice of the horses. Either one you fancy is yours.&rdquo; And
after the man had walked around the team several times and looked in
their mouths, he said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take the bay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the wife didn&rsquo;t like bay horses, and she called John aside, and
after whispering in his ear she allowed him to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll take the black horse,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said the pilgrim. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a chicken.&rdquo;</p>

the situation, and finally the president of the bank was called upon
to enlighten the dissatisfied customer. After a detailed explanation
of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> financial situation the president concluded, &ldquo;Now, my good

<p>Levinsky, despairing of his life, made an appointment with a famous

<p>After a few minutes he leaned over to a gentleman near him and

<p>&ldquo;One of the best,&rdquo; the gentleman told him.</p>

<p>Levinsky seemed to be worrying over something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, say,&rdquo; he whispered again, &ldquo;he must be pretty exbensive, then,

<p>The stranger was annoyed by Levinsky&rsquo;s questions and answered rather
shortly: &ldquo;Fifty dollars for the first consultation and twenty-five
dollars for each visit thereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine Gott!&rdquo; gasped Levinsky. &ldquo;Fifty tollars the first time und
twenty-five tollars each time afterwards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several minutes he seemed undecided whether to go or to wait. &ldquo;Und
twenty-five tollars each time afterward,&rdquo; he kept muttering. Finally,
just as he was called into the office, he was seized with a brilliant
inspiration. He rushed toward the doctor with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, doctor,&rdquo; he said effusively. &ldquo;Vell, here I am again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a big, black, good-hearted, old negro, stranded near Boston,
and he had decided, after considerable &ldquo;cogitation,&rdquo; to work his way
back to, the South, where he would feel more at home. In Boston, in
Springfield, in Hartford, in New Haven, it was always the same. When
he rang a bell and asked for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> work and a bite to eat the answer
usually was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, but there&rsquo;s not a thing to be done here
to-day.&rdquo; There were occasional exceptions, of course, or uncle could
never have got on, but the thing most to be counted upon was pleasing
politeness coupled with nothing else.</p>

<p>At last the old man left New York and then Philadelphia behind, and
one day found himself in Baltimore. His knowledge of geography was
<i>nil</i>, but he thought he ought soon to be getting into &ldquo;de Souf,&rdquo; and
with that hope at heart rang the bell of a fine house on Charles
Street. The door was opened by the host himself, who, after an
instant&rsquo;s survey of the figure before him, blurted out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yo&rsquo; &mdash;&mdash; black rascal! How dare yo&rsquo; ring this bell? Get off mah
steps this secon&rsquo;, befo&rsquo; I brek yo&rsquo; haid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I will, boss; &rsquo;deed I will,&rdquo; came the hurried answer. &ldquo;I wuz
on&rsquo;y lookin&rsquo; fer a bite to eat, boss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bite to eat!&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; know whar to go
for all yo&rsquo; want? Get yo&rsquo;self round back, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll feed yo&rsquo;
full&mdash;but cyart yo&rsquo; good-for-nuthin&rsquo; black carcass off these steps, I
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as uncle went around to the side door he raised his hands to
heaven, and with tears of rejoicing running down his furrowed cheeks,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bress de Lord! I&rsquo;s back agin among mah own folks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Former President Scott, of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad, was
greatly annoyed, when he first took hold of the road, by the claims
for horses and cattle killed by trains on their way through Kentucky.
It seemed as though it were not possible for a train to run north or
south through Kentucky without killing either a horse or a cow. And
every animal killed, however scrawny, scrubby, or miserable it may
have been before the accident, always figured in the claims
subsequently presented as of the best blood in Kentucky. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
Scott one day, after examining a claim, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything that

importuned by a tramp. The good religionist, after considerable
hesitation, produced a piece of dry bread which she delivered with the
following formula, evidently prepared for such occasion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, not for your sake, nor for my sake, but for God&rsquo;s sake, I
give you this bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tramp accepted the offering and had got as far as the gate when he
suddenly turned and came back where his benefactress was waiting to
see him safely out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, miss,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;not for your sake, nor for my sake, but for
God&rsquo;s sake put some butter on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, mother, mother, turn the hose on me!&rdquo; sang little Willie, as
his mama was dressing him one morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put my stockin&rsquo;s on wrong side out,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The will of Stephen Girard provided that no clergyman should ever be
allowed to enter the splendid Girard College at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>One day a very clerical looking man, with immaculate white cravat and
choker, approached the entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in here,&rdquo; said the janitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash; I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the janitor, &ldquo;excuse me. Step right in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is said that the visitor was the late State Senator Sessions, of
Western New York.</p>

<p>The following anecdote of ex-President Roosevelt&rsquo;s youth is told:</p>

<p>When Roosevelt was a student at Harvard he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> required to recite a
poem in public declamation. He got as far as a line which read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Greece her knees in suppliance bent,&rdquo; when he stuck there.</p>

<p>Again he tried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Greece her knees...,&rdquo; but could get no farther.</p>

<p>The teacher waited patiently, finally remarking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grease her knees again, Roosevelt, then perhaps she&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Young graduate in law, who had had some experience in New York City,
wrote to a prominent practitioner in Arkansas to inquire what chance
there was in that section for such a one as he described himself to
be. He said: &ldquo;I am a Republican in politics, and an honest young
lawyer.&rdquo; The reply that came seemed encouraging in its interest: &ldquo;If
you are a Republican the game laws here will protect you, and if you
are an honest lawyer you will have no competition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the immaculate young woman and the tired but happy-looking young
man entered the Pullman, followed by a grinning porter, the other
passengers became &ldquo;wise&rdquo; in a moment. The stout drummer leaned over to
the man behind him and remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bride and groom&mdash;100 to 1.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every one turned to view the newcomers, who had deposited themselves
vis-&agrave;-vis in No. 4. As if unconscious of any scrutiny, the young man
said, in a high, nasal voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you like about it; either increase the margin or let it
go. You didn&rsquo;t follow my advice in the first place, but if you want to
pull out, you&rsquo;d better do it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; the woman replied. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going all over it
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said the stout man&rsquo;s companion. &ldquo;Guess you lose. Been playing
the market. Not much bride and groom talk in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of the passengers sniffed and then turned their backs on the
new couple. Whereat the young man smiled at the young woman, and they
softly joined hands as he whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Millicent, dear, my shoes are full of rice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Short time ago an old lady went on board Nelson&rsquo;s flag-ship, the
<i>Victory</i>. The different objects of interest were duly shown her, and
on reaching the spot where the great naval hero was wounded (which is
marked by a raised brass plate), the officer remarked: &ldquo;Here Nelson
fell.&rdquo; &ldquo;And no wonder!&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady; &ldquo;I nearly fell there
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Good Samaritan, passing an apartment-house in the small hours of the
morning, noticed a man leaning limply against the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you live in this house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to help you upstairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With much difficulty he half dragged, half carried the drooping figure
up the stairway to the second floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What floor do you live on?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather than face an irate wife who might, perhaps, take him for a
companion more at fault than her spouse, he opened the first door he
came to and pushed the limp figure in.</p>

<p>The good Samaritan groped his way downstairs again. As he was passing
through the vestibule he was able to make out the dim outlines of
another man, apparently in worse condition than the first one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you drunk, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; was the feeble reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you live in this house, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I help you upstairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stopping on the second floor, where this man also said he lived, he
opened the door and pushed him in. As he again reached the front door
he discerned the shadow of a third man, evidently worse off than
either of the other two. He was about to approach him when the object
of his solicitude lurched out into the street and threw himself into
the arms of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> passing policeman. &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, off&rsquo;cer,&rdquo; he
gasped, &ldquo;protect me from that man. He&rsquo;s done nothin&rsquo; all night long
but carry me upstairs &rsquo;n&rsquo; throw me down th&rsquo; elevator shaf&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the school at which the writer was educated there was a certain
assistant master who invariably &ldquo;put his foot in it&rdquo; when he got the

be the biggest fool in the class as long as I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Barron was one of the new &ldquo;summer folk,&rdquo; and not acquainted with
the vernacular. Consequently, she was somewhat surprised, upon sending
an order for a roast of lamb to the nearest butcher, to receive the
following note in reply: &ldquo;Dear Mam. I am sorry I have not killed
myself this week, but I can get you a leg off my brother (the butcher
at the farther end of the town). He&rsquo;s full up of what you want. I seen
him last night with five legs. Yours respectful. George Gunton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after two o&rsquo;clock one bitter winter morning a physician drove
four miles in answer to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> telephone call. On his arrival the man who
had summoned him said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, I ain&rsquo;t in any particular pain, but somehow or other I&rsquo;ve got
a feeling that death is nigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor felt the man&rsquo;s pulse and listened to his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you made your will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, doctor, at my age&mdash;oh, Doc, it ain&rsquo;t true is it? It can&rsquo;t be
true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your lawyer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higginbotham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better send for him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patient, white and trembling, went to the &rsquo;phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your pastor?&rdquo; continued the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Kellogg M. Brown,&rdquo; mumbled the patient. &ldquo;But, doctor, do you
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send for him immediately. Your father, too, should be summoned; also
your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, doctor, do you really think I&rsquo;m going to die?&rdquo; The man began to
blubber softly.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied grimly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing at all the matter
with you. But I&rsquo;d hate to be the only man you&rsquo;ve made a fool of on a
night like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. L. E. Wilson, a wealthy young Baltimore physician, was awakened
one stormy night by a man who declared the doctor&rsquo;s services were
wanted three miles out in the country. Just before the doctor called
up the stable for his horse, the visitor asked what the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> charge would
be. &ldquo;Three dollars,&rdquo; was the reply. When the house containing the
supposed patient was reached, the man alighted first, and, handing the
doctor three dollars, remarked: &ldquo;That will be all, doctor. I couldn&rsquo;t
find a hackman who would do it for less than six dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A certain prosy preacher recently gave an endless discourse on the
prophets. First he dwelt at length on the minor prophets. At last he
finished them, and the congregation gave a sigh of relief. He took a
long breath and continued: &ldquo;Now I shall proceed to the major
prophets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the major prophets had received more than ample attention the
congregation gave another sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that I have finished with the minor prophets and the major
prophets, what about Jeremiah? Where is Jeremiah&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point a tall man arose in the back of the church. &ldquo;Jeremiah
can have my place,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any one who has traveled on the New York subway in rush hours can
easily appreciate the following:</p>

<p>A little man, wedged into the middle of a car, suddenly thought of
pickpockets, and quite as suddenly remembered that he had some money
in his overcoat. He plunged his hand into his pocket and was somewhat
shocked upon encountering the fist of a fat fellow-passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha&rdquo; snorted the latter. &ldquo;I caught you that time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leggo!&rdquo; snarled the little man. &ldquo;Leggo my hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pickpocket!&rdquo; hissed the fat man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; retorted the little one.</p>

<p>Just then a tall man in their vicinity glanced up from his paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get off here,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;if you fellows don&rsquo;t mind
taking your hands out of my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Mahaly, an old negress with a worthless husband, was relating her
troubles to her minister. The usual condolences were offered by the
latter and remedies suggested, but at each one Aunt Mahaly shook a
doubting head&mdash;she had tried them all without avail.</p>

<p>The minister sighed and pondered, and at last had an inspiration. He
leaned to Aunt Mahaly, who brightened visibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sis&rsquo; Mahaly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hab you eber tried heapin&rsquo; coals er fire on
his haid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleam of hope faded from Aunt Mahaly&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>A barber in South Bend, having been out late the night before, had a
shaky hand the next morning and cut a patron&rsquo;s cheek four times. After
each accident the barber said, as he sponged away the blood: &ldquo;Oh, dear
me, how careless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patron took all these gashes in grave silence. But when the shave
was over he filled a glass at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> water-cooler, took a mouthful of
water, and, with compressed lips, proceeded to shake his head from
side to side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; the barber asked. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got the toothache,
have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the customer; &ldquo;I only wanted to see if my mouth would still
hold water without leaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At one of the lectures by Professor George Kirchwey, dean of Columbia
Law College, New York, the students were uneasy. There was something
wrong in the air. Books were dropped, chairs were pushed along the
floor. There were various interruptions. The nerves of all were on
edge. The members of the class kept their eyes on the clock and
awaited the conclusion of the hour of the lecture. The clock beat
Professor Kirchwey by perhaps a minute, but at the expiration of the
schedule time the students started to their feet and prepared to
leave. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; objected Professor Kirchwey; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go just
yet. I have a few more pearls to cast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint <i>always</i> demanded instant and unquestioning obedience from
her children. One afternoon a storm came up and she sent her son John
to close the trapdoor leading to the roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mother&mdash;&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, I told you to shut the trapdoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but, Mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, shut that trapdoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mother, if you say so, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>John slowly climbed the stairs and shut the trapdoor. The storm howled
and raged. Two hours later the family gathered for tea. When the meal
was half over Aunt Mary had not appeared, and Mrs. Flint started an
investigation. She did not have to ask many questions; John answered
the first one:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mother, she is up on the roof.&rdquo;</p>

science. &ldquo;I am limping badly to-day. Do you think it&rsquo;s locomotor

<p>Henry Guy Carleton, wit, journalist, and playwright, has an impediment

<p>A lady from South America possessed of a decidedly quick temper came
to New York with a very incomplete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> knowledge of the English language.
At her hotel she rang for the chambermaid. But a waiter came instead.
Having ascertained that the name of the chambermaid was Susan, the
lady marshaled her meager knowledge of English in a desperate effort
to make the waiter understand that he should call the chambermaid.
What she said to him, however, was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Susan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter leaned against the wall much alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Susan!&rdquo; shouted the South American.</p>

<p>The waiter became appalled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Susan!&rdquo; roared the lady, her eyes flashing furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan, then&mdash;if you will have it!&rdquo; exclaimed the poor waiter. Then he
fled precipitately.</p>

<p>The reputed affinity between the Southern negro and unguarded poultry
is the subject of a story told by Senator Bacon, of Georgia. An old
colored man, notorious for his evil ways, after attending a revival
meeting, desired to lead a better life. At a later meeting he was
called up to be questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Rastus,&rdquo; said the revivalist, &ldquo;I hope you are now trying to
live a Christian life in accordance with the rules of the Church. Have
you been stealing any chickens lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sah! I ain&rsquo;t stole no chicken ob late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any turkeys or pigs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rastus, grieved, replied: &ldquo;No, sah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear that you have been doing better lately,&rdquo;
replied the evangelist. &ldquo;Continue to lead a holy and Christian life,
Rastus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the meeting was over, Rastus drew a long breath of relief, and
turning to his wife exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mandy, if he&rsquo;d said ducks I&rsquo;d been a lost nigger, suah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The late Moses Coit Tyler, so long Professor of History in Cornell,
was at one time a popular professor in the University of Michigan. One
raw February morning as he was calling the roll of an 8 o&rsquo;clock class
in English, he called &ldquo;Mr. Robbins,&rdquo; and receiving no answer called
again: &ldquo;Mr. Robbins?&rdquo; Still no reply. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Professor Tyler,
looking around upon the class in his inimitable manner, &ldquo;it is rather
early for robins.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>He&mdash;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t dinner ready yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She&mdash;&ldquo;No, dear. I got it according to the time you set the clock when
you came in last night, and dinner will be ready in four hours.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A foreigner, meeting an American friend, said to him, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;
The latter replied, &ldquo;Out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man considered this very clever, and decided to use the expression
on the next occasion. Shortly after he was met by a friend, who asked,
&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; With visible pride he answered, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>There is a clerk in the employ of a Philadelphia business man who,
while a fair worker, is yet an individual of pronounced eccentricity.</p>

<p>One day a wire basket fell off the top of the clerk&rsquo;s desk and
scratched his cheek. Not having any court plaster at hand, he slapped
on three two-cent postage stamps and continued his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later he had occasion to take some papers to his
employer&rsquo;s private office. When he entered, the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; observing
the postage stamps on his cheek fixed him with an astonished stare.
&ldquo;Look here, Jenkins!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You are carrying too much postage
for second-class matter!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the facetious stranger, watching a workman spread a
carpet from the church door to the curb, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the high road to
heaven you&rsquo;re fixing there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;this is merely a bridal path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope my little Tommy has taken to heart mama&rsquo;s talk of last night
about charity and usefulness,&rdquo; said a fond mother. &ldquo;How many acts of
kindness has he done? How many hearts has my Tommy made grateful and
glad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her Tommy replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a lot of good, ma; I gave your new hat to a beggar woman,
and I gave the cook&rsquo;s shoes to a little girl in busted rubbers what I
seen on the street, and I gave a poor, lame shoe-string seller pa&rsquo;s
black suit, the open front one that he hardly ever wears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles Francis Adams was escorting a literary friend about Boston.
They were viewing the different objects of attraction and finally came
to Bunker Hill. They stood looking at the splendid monument when</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Adams remarked: &ldquo;This is the place, sir, where Warren fell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the Englishman, evidently not very familiar with
American history. &ldquo;Was he seriously hurt by his fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Adams looked at his friend. &ldquo;Hurt!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He was killed, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed,&rdquo; the Englishman replied, still eying the monument and
commencing to compute its height in his own mind. &ldquo;Well, I should
think he might have been&mdash;falling so far.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; said his bride, &ldquo;I had a terrible feeling of sadness come
over me this afternoon&mdash;a sort of feeling that you were doing
something that would break my heart if I knew of it. Think, sweet,
what were you doing this afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; replied her husband, tenderly and reassuringly, &ldquo;at that
hour I was licking stamps and pasting them on envelopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few years ago a dear old lady, who formerly lived in Ipswich, and
was a relative of the poet Whittier, had occasion to go on a journey
which necessitated a night&rsquo;s ride in a sleeping car. Being subject to
attacks of acute indigestion, she took the precaution to place a few
leaves of the commercial mustard plaster in her hand bag.</p>

<p>During the night, pains, either real or imaginary, warned her of
trouble and prevented sleep. Deciding upon the application of a
plaster, she reached in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> dark for the hand bag, and, having
secured it, proceeded to put one of the leaves where it would do the
most good, and immediately felt comforted and enjoyed a refreshing
sleep until morning.</p>

<p>Upon removing the plaster, what was her astonishment to find that it
was a $10 bank note that had brought such speedy relief.</p>

<p>Beerbohm Tree was once endeavoring to get a well-known actor back into
his company. He invited the man to call and received him in his
dressing room as he was making-up. &ldquo;How much would you want to come
back to me?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Tree, busy with his paint pots. The other
named an exorbitant salary to which Tree merely retorted as he went on
making up: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t slam the door when you go out, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mama,&rdquo; she cried, rushing into her mother&rsquo;s room, and flinging
her arms around her mother&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;He loves me! He loves me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I&rsquo;m so glad! Has he told you? Has he asked you to be
his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he&rsquo;s down in the library learning to play chess with papa.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>&ldquo;If I had only known that this pleasure was in store for me,&rdquo; said the
doctor, as he shook hands cordially with his wife&rsquo;s cousins, &ldquo;I should
certainly have arranged my business so as to be home earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, pa,&rdquo; piped up little Tommy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> that ma told

<p>A minister of a fashionable church had always left the greeting of
strangers to be attended to by the ushers until he read some newspaper
articles in reference to the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose a representative should visit our church,&rdquo; said his wife.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; the minister admitted.</p>

<p>The following Sunday evening he noticed a plainly dressed woman in one
of the free pews. She sat alone and was clearly not a member of the
flock. After the benediction the minister hastened and intercepted her
at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he said, offering his hand. &ldquo;I am very glad to have
you with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied the young woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we may see you often in our church home,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;We are
always glad to welcome new faces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you live in this parish?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The girl looked blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will give me your address my wife and I will call on you some
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t need to go far, sir,&rdquo; said the young woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your
cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mission-workers on the East Side frequently see the humorous as
well as the sadder side of life. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> man prominent in reform work in
New York City recounts the experience of a certain young woman, new to
the task, who set about posting herself as to conditions in a
neighborhood near Avenue A.</p>

<p>The ambitious missionary had entered the house of an Irishwoman, and
had made some preliminary inquiries, when she was suddenly interrupted
by the woman, who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, youse is fresh at dis business, ain&rsquo;t youse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The amateur in mission work blushingly admitted such to be the case,
adding, &ldquo;I have never visited you before, Mrs. Muldoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thin,&rdquo; explained the Irishwoman, &ldquo;I tell ye what to do. Ye sit down
in that chair there, ye read me a short psalm, ye gives me fifty
cints, an&rsquo; thin ye goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fitz&mdash;&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long after the victories of Washington over the French and English had
made his name familiar to all Europe, Benjamin Franklin chanced to
dine with the English and French Ambassadors, when the following
toasts were drunk:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;England&rsquo;&mdash;The Sun, whose bright beams enlighten and fructify the
remotest corners of the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French Ambassador, filled with national pride, but too polite to
dispute the previous toast, offered the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;France&rsquo;&mdash;The Moon, whose mild, steady and cheering rays are the
delight of all nations, consoling them in darkness and making their
dreariness beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Franklin then arose, and, with his usual dignified simplicity,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;George Washington&rsquo;&mdash;The Joshua who commanded the Sun and Moon to
stand still, and they obeyed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following appeal of a Western editor is still going the rounds,
although it is to be hoped that by this time the writer&rsquo;s only trouble
is in having his vest made large enough:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We see by an esteemed contemporary that a young lady in Chicago is so
particular that she kneads bread with her gloves on. What of that? The
editor of this paper needs bread with his coat on; he needs bread with
his trousers on; in fact he needs bread with all of his clothes on.
And if some of his debtors don&rsquo;t pay up pretty quick he&rsquo;ll need bread
without anything at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> on, and this Western climate is no Garden of
Eden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unconscious humors of country journalism, says William Allen
White, are often more amusing than the best efforts of the alleged
&ldquo;funny man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Mr. White there once appeared in a Kansas paper the
following &ldquo;personal notice&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our prominent townsman Theodore Monkton is seriously ill. He is being
attended twice a day by Doctor Smith, in consultation with Doctor
Morgan. His recovery, therefore, is in great doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A crowd of small boys were gathered about the entrance of a circus
tent in one of the small cities in New Hampshire one day, trying to
get a glimpse of the interior. A man standing near watched them for a
few moments, then walking up to the ticket-taker he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let all these boys in, and count them as they pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did as requested, and when the last one had gone, he turned
and said, &ldquo;Twenty-eight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I guessed just right,&rdquo; and walked off.</p>

<p>The editor of a rural newspaper determined to adopt the idea of
posting bulletins on a bulletin board for all important events that
happened in the town. Soon afterward he was told one morning by the
local physician that Deacon Jones was seriously ill. The deacon was a
man of some distinction in the community,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> so the editor posted a
series of bulletins as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">10 a. m.</span>&mdash;Deacon Jones no better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">11 a. m.</span>&mdash;Deacon Jones has relapse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">12.30 p. m.</span>&mdash;Deacon Jones weaker. Pulse failing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">1 p. m.</span>&mdash;Deacon Jones has slight rally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2.15 p. m.</span>&mdash;Deacon Jones&rsquo;s family has been summoned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">3.10 p. m.</span>&mdash;Deacon Jones has died and gone to heaven.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon a traveling salesman happened by, stopped to
read the bulletins, and going to the bulletin board, made another
report concerning the deceased. It was:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">4.10 p. m.</span>&mdash;Great excitement in heaven. Deacon Jones has not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>A group of drummers were trading yarns on the subject of hospitality,
when one, a little Virginian with humorous eyes and a delightful
drawl, took up his parable thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was down in Louisiana last month, travelin&rsquo; &lsquo;cross country with a
friend, when we kinder got lost in a mighty lonesome sort of road just
about dark. We rode along a right good piece after sundown, and when
we saw a light ahead, I tell you it looked first-rate. We drove up to
the light, finding &rsquo;twas a house, and when I hollered like a lost calf
the man came out and we asked him to take us in for the night. He
looked at us mighty hard, then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wal, I reckon I kin stand it if you kin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we went in and found &rsquo;twas only a two-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> shanty, just swarmin&rsquo;
with children. He had six, from four to eleven years old; as there
didn&rsquo;t seem to be but one bed, me an&rsquo; Stony wondered what in thunder
would become of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They gave us supper, good hog and hominy, the best they had, and then
the old woman put the two youngest kids to bed. They went straight to
sleep. Then she took those out, laid them over in the corner, put the
next two to bed, and so on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all the children were asleep on the floor the old folk went in
the other room and told us we could go to bed if we wanted to, and
bein&rsquo; powerful tired out, we did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, the next morning when we woke up we were lying over in the
corner with the kids, and the old man and the old woman had the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As every one knows, the great Von Moltke never wasted words and
despised anything that approached garrulity in others. German army
officers are fond of telling an anecdote illustrative of this
peculiarity:</p>

<p>Von Moltke was leaving Berlin on a railway journey. Just before the
train pulled out of the station a captain of hussars entered the
general&rsquo;s compartment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> and, recognizing him, saluted with &ldquo;Guten
Morgen, Excellenz!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two hours later the train slowed up at a way station. The captain
arose, saluted, and with another &ldquo;Guten Morgen, Excellenz!&rdquo; left the
train.</p>

<p>Turning to one of his companions, Von Moltke said, with an expression
of the greatest disgust, &ldquo;Intolerable gas-bag!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A gentleman gave a large dinner party in Dublin once and invited Mr.
O&rsquo;Connor, one of the wittiest men in the Emerald Isle, to amuse and
divert his guests. Mr. O&rsquo;Connor accepted the invitation with pleasure.
But from the beginning to the end of dinner he preserved a solemn and
serious face. The host thought this very strange, and just before
rising from the table remarked to him jestingly, &ldquo;Why, O&rsquo;Connor, old
fellow, I don&rsquo;t believe the biggest fool in Ireland could make you
laugh to-night.&rdquo; Whereupon his guest answered in a solemn tone,
speaking his first word that evening, &ldquo;Try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Governor Guild of Massachusetts, who served in the Spanish War, tells
a story of a New York regiment, many of whose members were recruited
on the East Side. They were spoiling for a fight, and it became
necessary to post a sentry to preserve order.</p>

<p>A big husky Bowery recruit, of pugilistic propensities, was put on
guard outside, and given special orders to see that quiet reigned, and
above all things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> if trouble came his way, not to lose possession of
his rifle.</p>

<p>Soon a general row began, growing in proportions as the minutes
passed. The soldier walked his post nervously, without interrupting,
until the corporal of the guard appeared on the scene with
reenforcements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop this row?&rdquo; shouted the corporal.</p>

<p>The sentry, balancing his rifle on his shoulder, raised his arms to
the correct boxing position, and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, phwat could I do wid this gun in me hands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A New Jersey man recently reached the conclusion that his
eight-year-old boy is a trifle too bright.</p>

<p>At dinner one evening the father had been entertaining a number of
friends from Philadelphia with a funny story. This was at dessert. The
youngster had been very quiet throughout the previous courses; but
here he arose to the occasion in fine style.</p>

<p>When the laughter induced by his father&rsquo;s humor had ceased, the boy,
with a fine affectation of delight, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, dad, <i>do</i> tell the other one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed.</p>

<p>Not long ago a man was charged with shooting a number of pigeons, the
property of a farmer. In giving his evidence the farmer was
exceedingly careful, even nervous, and the solicitor for the defense
endeavored to frighten him. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;are you prepared to
swear that this man shot your pigeons?&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say he did shoot
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I said I suspected him o&rsquo; doing it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah! now
we&rsquo;re coming to it. What made you suspect that man?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, firstly, I
caught him on my land wi&rsquo; a gun. Secondly, I heerd a gun go off an&rsquo;

suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Bishop meditatively, &ldquo;I was once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A celebrated parson preached a rather long sermon from the text &ldquo;Thou

followed, greatly to the annoyance of the minister. Another person was
about to retire when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> the minister stopped his sermon and said:

<p>A red-faced man was holding the attention of a little group with some
wonderful recitals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most exciting chase I ever had,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;happened a few years
ago in Russia. One night, when sleighing about ten miles from my
destination I discovered, to my intense horror, that I was being
followed by a pack of wolves. I fired blindly into the pack, killing
one of the brutes, and to my delight saw the others stop to devour it.
After doing this, however, they still came on. I kept on repeating the
dose, with the same result, and each occasion gave me an opportunity
to whip up my horse. Finally there was only one wolf left, yet on it
came, with its fierce eyes glowing in anticipation of a good, hot
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the man who had been sitting in the corner burst forth into a fit
of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by your way of reckoning that last wolf must
have had the rest of the pack inside him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the red-faced man without a tremor, &ldquo;now I remember, it did
wobble a bit.&rdquo;</p>

before. The woman was clad in deep mourning which had an air of
newness about it. Mrs. S. hastened to greet the woman. &ldquo;How is this,

<p>Those who know a certain Southern Senator will picture his ample
proportions when they read this story:</p>

<p>While journeying through the South, he was very much annoyed one day
at the delay in getting food served in a certain <i>caf&eacute;</i>. He had given
his order, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> waited impatiently an unreasonable length of time,
when the waiter appeared and was evidently looking for some one who
must have gone out without waiting for his meal.</p>

<p>When asked by the Senator whom he was looking for he replied.</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s mother had been walking up and down the piazza with him
repeating Mother Goose. She began the &ldquo;Solomon Grundy&rdquo; one, going
through it rapidly without taking breath, ending laughingly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;Worse on Friday,</div>
<div class="verse00">Died on Saturday,</div>
<div class="verse00">Buried on Sunday,</div>

<div class="verse00">Of Solomon Grundy.&rdquo;</div>

<p>Jack took his thumb out of his mouth, looked reprovingly at his mother

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, mama: that&rsquo;s <i>awful</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David B. Hill, former Governor of and Senator from New York, has a
secluded hatter somewhere in the State who makes his high hats after
elaborate plans drawn by Mr. Hill many years ago, and not changed
since.</p>

<p>One night Governor Odell, of New York, was giving a reception in
Albany, and President Roosevelt, then elected Vice-President, met Mr.
Hill on the steps of the New York Executive mansion.</p>

<p>Roosevelt wore a black rough-rider hat and Hill had one of his
peculiar sky-pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senator,&rdquo; said Roosevelt, &ldquo;you should wear a hat like this one that I
have on. They are much easier on the head, preserve the hair and are
altogether better than silk ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hill looked at the coming Vice-President. &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t worn a hat like that since I went out of the show
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A negress was brought before a magistrate charged with cruelly
treating her child. Evidence was clear that she had severely beaten
the youngster, who was in court to exhibit his marks and bruises.
Before imposing sentence the magistrate asked the woman if she had
anything to say. &ldquo;Kin Ah ask yo&rsquo; honah a question?&rdquo; His honor nodded.
&ldquo;Well, yo&rsquo; honah, I&rsquo;d like to ask yo&rsquo; whether yo&rsquo; was ever the father
of a puffectly wuthless culled chile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A traveling man stopped at an Indiana hotel. The proprietor told him
he had not a room in the house. The man said he must have a room.
Finally the proprietor told him there was a room, a little room
separated by a thin partition from a nervous man who had lived in the
house for ten years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is so nervous,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare put any one in
that room. The least noise might give him a nervous spell that would
endanger his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, give me a room,&rdquo; said the traveler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so quiet he&rsquo;ll not
know I&rsquo;m there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was given the traveler. He slipped in noiselessly and began
to disrobe. He took off one article of clothing after another as
quietly as a burglar. At last he came to his shoes. He unlaced a shoe
and dropped it.</p>

<p>The shoe fell to the floor with a great noise. The offending traveler,
horrified at what he had done, waited to hear from the nervous man.
Not a sound. He took off the second shoe and placed it noiselessly
upon the floor; then in absolute silence finished undressing and
crawled between the sheets.</p>

<p>Half an hour went by. He had dropped into a doze when there came a
tremendous knocking on the partition.</p>

<p>The traveler sat up in bed trembling and dismayed. &ldquo;Wh-wha-what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the voice of the nervous man:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang you! Drop that other shoe, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was once an Irishman, who sought employment as a diver, bringing
with him his native enthusiasm and a certain amount of experience.
Although he had never been beneath the water, he had crossed an ocean
of one variety and swallowed nearly an ocean of another. But he had
the Hibernian smile, which is convincing, and the firm chanced to need
a new man. And so on the following Monday morning Pat hid his smile
for the first time in a diving helmet.</p>

<p>Now, the job upon which the crew to which Pat had attached himself was
working in comparatively shallow water, and Pat was provided with a
pick and told to use it on a ledge below in a manner with which he was
already familiar.</p>

<p>Down he went with his pick, and for about fifteen minutes nothing was
heard from him. Then came a strong, determined, deliberate pull on the
signal rope, indicating that Pat had a very decided wish to come to
the top. The assistants pulled him hastily to the raft and removed his
helmet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off the rest of it,&rdquo; said Pat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off the rest of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;Oi&rsquo;ll worruk no longer in a dark place where Oi
can&rsquo;t spit on me hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the first day that a young man began his duties as reporter on a
popular paper a report came from a near-by town that there was a
terrible fire raging. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> editor of the paper immediately sent the
new reporter to the place, and, upon arriving there, he found that the
firemen were unable to get control of the fire, so he sent this
telegram to the editor: &ldquo;Fire still raging. What shall I do?&rdquo; The
editor was so mad that he wired back at once: &ldquo;Find out where the fire
is the hottest and jump in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; related Denny to his friend Jerry, &ldquo;when Oi had wandered

hot breath burnin&rsquo; on the back of me neck, we came to a big lake. Wid
one great leap Oi landed safe on the opposite shore, leavin&rsquo; me

<p>Quite recently an old friend of the Browns went to see them at their
new country home. As he approached the house a large dog ran out to
the gate and began barking at him through the fence.</p>

<p>As he hesitated about opening the gate, Brown&rsquo;s wife came to the door
and exclaimed: &ldquo;How do you do! Come right in. Don&rsquo;t mind the dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t he bite?&rdquo; exclaimed the friend, not anxious to meet the
canine without some assurance of his personal safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to find out,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Brown. &ldquo;I just
bought him this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stopping to strop his razor, and prepared, with brush in hand to

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; drawled Ralph, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly necessary. I think I can

<p>The following is a typical Ian Maclaren story:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who had this place last year?&rdquo; asked a Southern shooting tenant of
his keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Donald, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denyin&rsquo; that he wass an Englishman, but
he wass a good man whatever. Oh, yess, he went to kirk and he shot
very well, but he wass narrow, very narrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Narrow,&rdquo; said the other in amazement, for he supposed he meant
bigoted, and the charge was generally the other way about. &ldquo;What was
he narrow in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Donald, &ldquo;I will be tellin&rsquo; you, and it wass this way. The
twelfth [the beginning of the grouse shooting] wass a very good day,
and we had fifty-two brace. But it wass warm, oh! yess, very warm, and
when we came back to the Lodge, the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> will say to me, &lsquo;It is
warm.&rsquo; and I will not be contradicting him. Then he will be saying,
&lsquo;Maybe you are thirsty,&rsquo; and I will not be contradicting him.
Afterwards he will take out his flask and be speaking about a dram. I
will not be contradicting him, but will just say, &lsquo;Toots, toots.&rsquo; Then
he will be pouring it out, and when the glass wass maybe half-full I
will say, just for politeness, &lsquo;Stop.&rsquo; And he stopped. Oh! yess, a
very narrow man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark Twain as a humorist is no respecter of persons, and a story is
told of him and Bishop Doane which is worth repeating. It occurred
when Mark Twain was living in Hartford, where Mr. Doane was then
rector of an Episcopal church. Twain had listened to one of the
doctor&rsquo;s best sermons, on Sunday morning, when he approached him and
said politely: &ldquo;I have enjoyed your sermon this morning. I welcomed it
as I would an old friend. I have a book in my library that contains
every word of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Impossible, sir,&rdquo; replied the rector, indignantly.
&ldquo;Not at all. I assure you it is true,&rdquo; said Twain. &ldquo;Then I shall
trouble you to send me that book,&rdquo; rejoined the rector with dignity.
The next morning Dr. Doane received, with Mark Twain&rsquo;s compliments, a
dictionary.</p>

<hr class="sub-div" />

<p>A friend of Mark Twain&rsquo;s tells of an amusing incident in connection
with the first meeting between the humorist and the late James McNeil
Whistler, the artist.</p>

<p>The friend having facetiously warned Clemens that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> the painter was a
confirmed joker, Mark solemnly averred that he would get the better of
Whistler should the latter attempt &ldquo;any funny business.&rdquo; Furthermore,
Twain determined to anticipate Whistler, if possible.</p>

<p>So, when the two had been introduced, which event took place in
Whistler&rsquo;s studio, Clemens, assuming an air of hopeless stupidity,
approached a just-completed painting, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all bad, Mr. Whistler, not at all bad. Only,&rdquo; he added,
reflectively, with a motion as if to rub out a cloud effect, &ldquo;if I
were you I&rsquo;d do away with that cloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Whistler, almost beside himself. &ldquo;Do
be careful not to touch that; the paint is not yet dry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; responded Twain, with an air of perfect
nonchalance; &ldquo;I am wearing gloves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a story of Italian revenge. A vender of plaster statuettes saw
a chance for a sale in a well-dressed, bibulous man who was tacking
down the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You buy-a de statuette?&rdquo; he asked, alluringly holding out his
choicest offering. &ldquo;Gar-r-ribaldi&mdash;I sell-a him verra cheep. De
gr-reat-a Gar-r-ribaldi&mdash;only thirta cents!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, t&rsquo;ell with Garibaldi,&rdquo; said the bibulous one, making a swipe with
his arm that sent Garibaldi crashing to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>For a moment the Italian regarded the fragments. Then, his eyes
flashing fire, he seized from his stock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> a statuette of George
Washington. &ldquo;You t&rsquo;ell-a with my Gar-r-ribaldi?&rdquo; he hissed between his
teeth. &ldquo;So.&rdquo; He raised the immortal George high above his head
and&mdash;crash! it flew into fragments alongside of the ill-fated
Garibaldi. &ldquo;Ha! I to hell-a wid your George-a Wash! Ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appears that the late Senator John T. Morgan, who was quite
near-sighted, while at dessert one evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> in a hotel at Hot Springs,
Virginia, experienced considerable difficulty in separating from the
plate passed him by the colored waiter what he thought was a chocolate
eclair. It stuck fast, so Senator Morgan pushed his fork quite under
it, and tried again and again to pry it up.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware that his friends at the table were convulsed
with laughter, which much mystified him. But his surprise was even
greater when the waiter quietly remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Senator, but that&rsquo;s my thumb!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A doctor named Brown had been the adorer for many years of a Miss
White. Unluckily his ardent love was not reciprocated. He had a
reputation for ready wit and did not allow even his unfortunate love
affair to stand in the way of his exercising it. One night over a
glass of wine in the club the good doctor frequented a wag remarked,
&ldquo;What do you say, doctor, to my giving the toast of Miss White, your
old flame?&rdquo; &ldquo;You may, and you&rsquo;ll not do any harm either to her or to
me by toasting her as often as you please, for I&rsquo;ve toasted her all
these years and there are still no symptoms of her turning Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman who traveled a great deal in the West was known as the most
inveterate &ldquo;kicker&rdquo; a certain hotel had ever known.</p>

<p>One evening after she had been served with dessert this lady, who was
always complaining, asked the waiter why the dish served her was
called &ldquo;ice-cream pudding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll bring you something else,&rdquo;
suggested the polite negro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very nice,&rdquo; responded the lady. &ldquo;What I object to is that it
should be called ice-cream pudding. It&rsquo;s wrongly named. There should
be ice cream served with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the waiter, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s jest our name for it.
Lots o&rsquo; dishes that way. Dey don&rsquo;t bring you a cottage with cottage

<p>During a certain cruise the first mate of a ship got to drinking to
excess and was intoxicated for several days. One day, after having
come out of this state, he examined the log book to see what had
passed during his period of semi-forgetfulness. He was horrified to
find entered in the book for the three days consecutively, &ldquo;The first
mate is drunk to-day.&rdquo; He did not want this to stand as it would
hardly be a good recommendation for him to the ship owners and asked
the captain to remove the entries.</p>

<p>The captain replied, &ldquo;It is the truth, is it not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
replied the mate. The captain interrupted him, &ldquo;If it is the truth,
the truth must stand. It is written in ink and can not be removed
without injuring the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time afterward the captain was taken ill and remained so for a
week, and it devolved upon the mate to keep the log book. The captain
on recovering from his illness got the book to examine it to see how
the mate had done his duty. Imagine his consternation when he read in
each of the seven days&rsquo; entries, &ldquo;The captain is sober to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain immediately called the mate and indignantly questioned him
in regard to these entries. The mate replied, &ldquo;It is the truth, is it
not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; replied the captain. The mate interrupted him, &ldquo;If
it is the truth, the truth must stand, must it not? I have your word
that the writing in ink can not be erased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the first week of his honeymoon,&rdquo; said the hotel barber, &ldquo;and
he came in and sat down near the door to wait his turn. I yelled
&lsquo;Next&rsquo; at him two or three times when my chair was vacant, but he was
dreaming and didn&rsquo;t hear me. Finally I touched him on the shoulder and
told him I was ready for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want me to do?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, get in the chair if you want anything,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;This is a
barber shop.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; he said, and then he got into the chair. He leaned back,
so I let the chair down and shaved him. He didn&rsquo;t have a word to say.
When I finished him up he got out of the chair and took the check over
to the cashier. He paid and started out. When halfway through the door
he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Say,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;what did you do to me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shaved you,&rsquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Darn the luck,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I wanted a haircut.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I said to my boss,&rdquo; interrupted the agent. &ldquo;I told

all the time. I tell you, Mr. Grump, this city has mighty few men such

them how great they are, but you are above such weakness. Any one can

it inspire one with renewed vigor?&rdquo; Casey leaned over, with hand to

not hear them pealing? Do they not imbue you with a feeling of almost
reverence? Do they not awaken tender memories of the past?&rdquo; Casey

salutation of old Trinity on a Sabbath morning? Do they not take you
back into the dim vistas of the past when the world was young, and
touch your heart with a feeling of pathos?&rdquo; Casey put his mouth close

<p>In Alabama they tell this story to illustrate Senator Morgan&rsquo;s ability
as an advocate. A negro of well-known thieving proclivities was on
trial for stealing a mule. Morgan defended and cleared him. As lawyer
and client were walking out of the courtroom Mr. Morgan said: &ldquo;Rastus,
did you steal the mule?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, Marse Morgan, it was jes like dis: I
really thought I did steal dat mule, but after what you said to the
jury I was convince&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Walter, with his little niece Ruth in his lap, was about to
telephone a message to a distant city. While waiting for the
connection to be made little Ruth asked if she might talk over the
open wire. The young lady operator heard the question and said, &ldquo;Yes,
please let her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth, taking the receiver, first told her name. Then the operator
asked her where she was, and to this Ruth replied:</p>

<p>Apropos of vanity, Senator Root told at Yale about a politician who,
the day before he was to make a certain speech, sent a forty-one-page

&ldquo;But the hour grows late, and I must close. (No, no! Go on! Go on!)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two women from the country were at the circus for the first time. They

<p>Senator Ingalls was always quick at retort, although he was himself a
subject of some sharp shafts. Once he was attacked by Senator Eli
Saulsbury, of Delaware, the second smallest State in the Union. He

that great State, which has three counties at low tide and two
counties at high tide, for his advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young and bashful professor was frequently embarrassed by jokes his
girl pupils would play on him. These jokes were so frequent that he
decided to punish the next perpetrators, and the result of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
decision was that two girls were detained an hour after school, and
made to work some difficult problems, as punishment.</p>

<p>It was the custom to answer the roll-call with quotations, so the
following morning, when Miss A&rsquo;s name was called, she rose, and,
looking straight in the professor&rsquo;s eye, repeated: &ldquo;With all thy
faults I love thee still,&rdquo; while Miss B&rsquo;s quotation was: &ldquo;The hours I
spend with thee, dear heart, are as a string of pearls to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archbishop Patrick J. Ryan, of Philadelphia, once received a call from

<p>On one of his collecting trips through Scotland the eminent English
geologist, Hugh Miller, at the end of the day gave to a servant his
bag of specimen stones which he had labored all day to collect, to be
carried some miles to his home. Later, while sitting unobserved in a
corner of the village inn, he heard the man communicating to a friend
in Gaelic his experience with the &ldquo;mad Englishman,&rdquo; as he called him,
in the following manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave me his bag to carry home by a short-cut across the hills
while he walked by another road. I was wondering why it was so
fearfully heavy, and when I got out of his sight I made up my mind to
see what was in it. I opened it, and what do you think it was?
Stones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stones!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion, opening his eyes. &ldquo;Stones! Well,
that beats all I ever heard or knew of one of them. And did you carry
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carry it! Do you think I was as mad as himself? No, no. I emptied
them all out of the bag, but I filled it again from the stone-heap
near the house, and gave him good measure for his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Former Representative Gibson, of Tennessee, had a voice that would
play tricks with him. It would work all right for a few minutes, and
then it would stop entirely, and Gibson would be left gasping for a
moment or two, high and dry in the middle of his argument, until his
voice came back again. He was making a tariff speech one day, sailing
along in fine shape. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;the tariff is
like a pair of suspenders. Uncle Sam needs it to keep up his&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right there his voice broke. Gibson couldn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trousers!&rdquo; yelled one member.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pants!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breeches!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time the voice came back&mdash;&ldquo;to keep up his revenues,&rdquo; said
Gibson, glaring around at his tormentors.</p>

<p>Senator Tillman not long ago piloted a plain farmer-constituent around
the Capitol for a while, and then, having some work to do on the
floor, conducted him to the Senate gallery.</p>

<p>After an hour or so the visitor approached a gallery doorkeeper and
said: &ldquo;My name is Swate. I am a friend of Senator Tillman. He brought
me here and I want to go out and look around a bit. I thought I would
tell you so I can get back in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper, &ldquo;but I may not be here when
you return. In order to prevent any mistake I will give you the

<p>Swate&rsquo;s eyes rather popped out at this. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idiosyncrasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idiosyncrasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll stay in,&rdquo; said Swate.</p>

<p>The Willoughbys had said good-by to Mrs. Kent. Then Mr. Willoughby
spoke thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was pleasant of her to say that about wishing she could see more
of people like us, who are interested in real things, instead of the
foolish round of gaiety that takes up so much of her time and gives
her so little satisfaction, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife stole a sidewise glance at his gratified face and a satirical
smile crossed her own countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pleasant, George,&rdquo; she said clearly. &ldquo;But what I knew she meant,
and what she knew that I knew she meant, was that my walking-skirt is
an inch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> too long and my sleeves are old style, and your coat, poor

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;how&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Willoughby helplessly; then he shook his

<p>Mrs. Wharton, the novelist, has never described any blunder of the

and when asked the origin of his terrors, explained: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
heard you&rsquo;re such a frightful blackleg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenthal, the pianist, speaks eight or ten languages. But his

the manager&rsquo;s office, he suddenly asked: &ldquo;Vat iss &lsquo;Fourt&rsquo; of July

<p>&ldquo;Fourth of July?&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the Fourth of July?
Why, the national holiday&mdash;everything noble and patriotic&mdash;George

&ldquo;Ah! I see,&rdquo; said the pianist, &ldquo;Un grand compliment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The late Charles Eliot Norton was wont to deplore the modern youth&rsquo;s

and &ldquo;Annabel Lee,&rdquo; said to the lad at his side: &ldquo;He plays well, that
Poe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; the youth cried. &ldquo;Is he,&rdquo; said Professor Norton, &ldquo;any

<p>A fire broke out one day in Francis Wilson&rsquo;s dressing-room at the
theater where he was playing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>He had some of his books around him, and in an agony of despair asked
himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which shall I save?&rdquo; He glanced at his precious Chaucer, at some
Shakespearean volumes, when:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Wilson,&rdquo; broke in at the door from a fireman, &ldquo;you have not
a moment to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Coming,&rdquo; replied Wilson absently.</p>

<p>He was looking for a special illuminated volume very dear to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Wilson,&rdquo; cried his manager; &ldquo;come, get out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; said Wilson, and, grabbing some clothes in one
hand, he snatched with the other the nearest volume and ran to the
street. There he looked at the huge volume in his arms. It was the

<p>A city gentleman was recently invited down to the country for &ldquo;a day

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; at last exclaimed the sportsman, &ldquo;but the birds seem
exceptionally strong on the wing this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all of &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shot at the same bird
about a dozen times. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a-follerin&rsquo; you about, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following me about? Nonsense! Why should a bird do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lady was calling on some friends one summer afternoon. The talk
buzzed along briskly, fans waved and the daughter of the house kept
twitching uncomfortably, frowning and making little smothered
exclamations of annoyance. Finally, with a sigh, she rose and left the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your daughter,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;seems to be suffering from the

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the hostess. &ldquo;She is just back home from college and she is

<p>&ldquo;This here room is full of sacred associations to me,&rdquo; she went on, as
she bustled around opening shutters and arranging the curtains. &ldquo;My
first husband died in that bed with his head on these very pillers,
and poor Mr. Jinks died settin&rsquo; right in that corner. Sometimes when I
come into the room in the dark I think I see him settin&rsquo; there still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own father died layin&rsquo; right on that lounge under the winder. Poor
pa! He was a Speeritualist, and he allus said he&rsquo;d appear in this room
after he died, and sometimes I&rsquo;m foolish enough to look for him. If
you should see anything of him to-night you&rsquo;d better not tell me; for
it&rsquo;d be a sign to me that there was something in Speeritualism, and
I&rsquo;d hate to think that.</p>

<p>Mr. George Broadhurst, author of the play, &ldquo;The Man of the Hour,&rdquo; is
an Englishman, and recently made a visit to his native country. After
having lived a week at one of the large hotels in London, he was
surprised on the evening of his departure, although at a very late
hour, to see an endless procession of waiters, maids, porters, and
pages come forward with the expectant smile and empty hand. When each
and all had been well bestowed, even boots and under-boots and then
another boots, he dashed for the four-wheeler that was to carry him
safely away.</p>

<p>Settling himself with a sigh of relief, he was about to be off when a
page popped his head into the window and breathlessly exclaimed:</p>

remarking that he had now paid her the twenty dollars he had promised
her. She, in turn, paid it to Mr. Black to settle her bread and pastry
account. Mr. Black handed it to Mr. Hadley, asking credit for the
amount on his flour bill, Mr. Hadley again returning it to Mr. Brown,

Brown put it back into his pocketbook, observing that he had not

through his fingers to the floor, lighted on the back of a cockroach

cockroach&mdash;what he did see was his escaped postage stamp zig-zagging
aimlessly across the floor to the baseboard, wavering up over the
baseboard and following a crooked track up the wall and across the

wife hurriedly entered the room. &ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
swallowed a pin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Professor smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, my dear,&rdquo; he said in a
soothing tone. &ldquo;It is of no consequence. Here&rdquo;&mdash;he fumbled at his
lapel&mdash;&ldquo;Here is another pin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The late Theodore Thomas was rehearsing the Chicago Orchestra on the
stage of the Auditorium Theater. He was disturbed by the whistling of
Burridge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> the well-known scene painter, who was at work in the loft
above the stage. A few minutes later Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s librarian appeared
on the &ldquo;bridge,&rdquo; where Mr. Burridge, merrily whistling, was at work.
&ldquo;Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s compliments,&rdquo; said the librarian, &ldquo;and he requests me to
say that if Mr. Burridge wishes to whistle he will be glad to
discontinue his rehearsal.&rdquo; To which Mr. Burridge replied suavely:
&ldquo;Mr. Burridge&rsquo;s compliments to Mr. Thomas; and please inform Mr.
Thomas that, if Mr. Burridge can not whistle with the orchestra, he
won&rsquo;t whistle at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When trouble was more general and more destructive in Ireland than at
present, an Irish priest, a very good man, was disturbed by the
inroads which strong drink was making on his flock. He preached a
strong sermon against it. &ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that keeps you
poor? It&rsquo;s the drink. What is it keeps your children half-starved? The
drink. What is it keeps your children half-clothed? The drink! The
drink. What is it causes you to shoot at your landlords&mdash;and miss
them? The drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goff, the famous London barrister, has a humor peculiarly his own. He
looks at the world in a half-amused, half-indulgent manner sometimes
very annoying to his friends. One day, when in town, he dropped into a
restaurant for lunch. It was a tidy, although not a pretentious
establishment. After a good meal he called to the waitress and
inquired what kind of pie could be had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Apple pie mince pie raisin pie blueberry pie custard pie peach pie
and strawberry shortcake,&rdquo; the young woman repeated glibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please say that again?&rdquo; he asked, leaning a trifle forward.</p>

<p>The girl went through the list at lightning rate. &ldquo;And strawberry
shortcake,&rdquo; she concluded with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind doing it once more?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The waitress looked her disgust, and started in a third time
pronouncing the words in a defiantly clear tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he remarked when she had finished. &ldquo;For the life of me I
can not see how you do it. But I like to hear it. It&rsquo;s very
interesting, very. Give me apple pie, please, and thank you very
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An elderly Bishop, a bachelor, who was very fastidious about his
toilet, was especially fond of his bath, and requested particular care
of his tub from the maid.</p>

<p>When about to leave town one day he gave strict orders to the
housemaid about his &ldquo;bawth-tub&rdquo; and said that no one was to be allowed
the use of it.</p>

<p>Alas! the temptation grew on the girl and she took a plunge.</p>

<p>The Bishop returned unexpectedly, and finding traces of the recent
stolen bath, questioned the maid so closely that she had to confess
she was the culprit, and was very sorry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you do not think it a sin, Bishop?&rdquo; asked Mary in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Eying her sternly, he said: &ldquo;Mary your using my tub is not a sin, but
what distresses me most is that you would do anything behind my back
that you would not do before my face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senator Dawes, in his young manhood, was a very poor speaker. One time
he was in an important law case, and for his opponent he had an older
attorney whose eloquence attracted a crowd that packed the courtroom.</p>

<p>The day was very hot and the judge on the bench was freely perspiring.
Finally the judge, drawing off his coat in the midst of the lawyer&rsquo;s
eloquent address, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Attorney, excuse me, but suppose you sit down and let Dawes begin
to speak. I want to thin out this crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philander C. Knox tells this story of Roosevelt: &ldquo;Roosevelt,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;was surprised by a Kansas delegation at Oyster Bay one summer. The
President appeared with his coat and collar off, trousers hitched by
belt, and mopping his forehead. &lsquo;Ah, gentlemen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;<i>de</i>lighted
to see you, <i>de</i>lighted. But I am very busy putting in my hay, you
know. Just come down to the barn with me and we&rsquo;ll talk it over while
I work.&rsquo; Down to the barn hustled the delegation and Mr. Roosevelt
seized a pitchfork. But, behold there was no hay on the floor! &lsquo;John,&rsquo;
shouted the President to sounds in the hayloft; &lsquo;where&rsquo;s all the hay?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t had time to throw it back since you threw it up yesterday,
sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the President of a certain Western college had attained his
present high position, a boy entering college was recommended to his
consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to draw the boy out, Professor; criticise him, and tell us what
you think,&rdquo; the parents said.</p>

<p>To facilitate acquaintance the Professor took the boy for a walk.
After ten minutes&rsquo; silence the youth ventured: &ldquo;Fine day, Professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a far-away look.</p>

<p>Ten minutes more, and the young man, squirming uncomfortably, said:
&ldquo;This is a pleasant walk, Professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Another silence, and then the young man blurted out that he thought
they might have rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and this time the Professor went on saying, &ldquo;Young man, we have
been walking together for half an hour, and you have said nothing
which was not commonplace and stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, his irritation getting the better of his modesty,
&ldquo;and you endorsed every word I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Word from the Professor to the parents was to the effect that the boy
was all right.</p>

<p>A dear old citizen went to the cars the other day to see his daughter
off on a journey. Securing her a seat he passed out of the car and
went around to the car window to say a last parting word. While he was
leaving the car the daughter crossed the aisle to speak to a friend,
and at the same time a grim old maid took the seat and moved up to the
window.</p>

<p>Unaware of the change the old gentleman hurriedly put his head up to
the window and said: &ldquo;One more kiss, pet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another instant the point of a cotton umbrella was thrust from the
window, followed by the wrathful injunction: &ldquo;Scat, you gray-headed
wretch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a young physician who has never been able to smoke a cigar.
&ldquo;Just one poisons me,&rdquo; says the youthful doctor.</p>

<p>Recently the doctor was invited to a large dinner-party. When the
women had left the table cigars were accepted by all the men except
the physician.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> Seeing his friend refuse the cigar the host in
astonishment exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, not smoking? Why, my dear fellow, you lose half your dinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know I do,&rdquo; meekly replied the doctor, &ldquo;but if I smoked one I
should lose the whole of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once, when Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes was at a charitable fair, he was
asked to furnish a letter for the &ldquo;post-office.&rdquo; So he placed a
one-dollar note inside a sheet of paper and wrote on the first page:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>As several travelers got into the station &rsquo;bus one of the men (who was
quite a portly fellow) noticed that a certain young woman had a grip
exactly like his, but that it was placed with the rest of the luggage,
on top. Thinking there might be some mistake made he kept his inside
and placed it at his feet. He was soon engrossed in his paper, and did
not notice the young woman reach over and draw the grip close to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
side. Being of a humorous turn of mind he waited until she was
occupied with a book and then pulled the grip to its former position,
the rest of the travelers looking on with amused expressions.</p>

<p>In turning over a leaf she looked down and suddenly became aware of
the removal of the grip. She was quite indignant, and with some force
in her voice and manner said, &ldquo;That is <i>mine</i>!&rdquo; and jerked it back
close to her feet.</p>

<p>Touching his hat politely the owner said, with a merry twinkle in his
eye: &ldquo;All right, madam; but may I please get my pipe and nightshirt
out? You are welcome to the rest of the things!&rdquo;</p>

<p>President Eliot, of Harvard, is not a believer in spelling reform. Not
long ago there was a student who was a candidate for the degree of
doctor of philosophy. This student had adopted spelling reform as his
particular line of work, and as commencement day drew near he went to
President Eliot with a request. &ldquo;You know, Mr. President,&rdquo; he said
&ldquo;that you are proposing to make me a Ph.D. Now I have made a specialty
of spelling reform and I always spell philosophy with an &lsquo;f.&rsquo; I
therefore called to ask you if you could not make my degree F. D.,
instead of Ph.D.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the President. &ldquo;In fact, if you insist, we shall
make it a D. F.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following letter was received by the Post-office Department. It
came from a Western postmaster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> at a small office and read: &ldquo;In

that on next Saturday I will close the post-office for one day, as I
am going on a bear hunt. I am not asking your permission to close up
and don&rsquo;t give a damn if you discharge me; but I will advise now, that
I am the only man in the county who can read and write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young lady at a summer hotel asked an artist friend, who was
spending his vacation there, if he would mind doing a small favor for
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he said eagerly; &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; she exclaimed gratefully. &ldquo;I wish you would stop
at Mrs. Gannon&rsquo;s little shop and get three large bone buttons, the
kind with two small holes in them. They&rsquo;re for my new bathing suit,
you know. Just tell her who I am and it will be all right. You needn&rsquo;t
pay for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the artist was a bachelor, and had never bought anything but
collar buttons before. So on the way to the store he kept repeating
the instructions that he had received. Eager to relieve his mind he
rushed up to Mrs. Gannon and reeled off this surprising speech: &ldquo;I
want three bone buttons for a small bathing suit with two large holes
in it. Just tell me who I am and it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>

Bourbon verdancy. The Judge asked her in a kindly voice what took

<p>Going into a port where the water was very deep&mdash;Rio de Janeiro, I
believe&mdash;relates Captain A. T. Mahan, the chain cables &ldquo;got away,&rdquo; as
the expression is, control was lost, and shackle after shackle tore
out of the hawse-holes with tremendous rattling and roaring. The
admiral was on deck at the moment, and when the chain had been stopped
and secured he said to the captain: &ldquo;Alfred, send for the young man in
charge of those chains and give him a good setting-down. Ask him what
he means by letting such things happen.&rdquo; Alfred was a mild person, and
clearly did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> like his job; he could not have come up to the
admiral&rsquo;s standard. The latter saw it, and said: &ldquo;Perhaps you had
better leave it to me. I&rsquo;ll settle him.&rdquo; Fixing his eyes on the
offender, he said, sternly: &ldquo;What do you mean by this, sir? Why the
hell didn&rsquo;t you stop that chain?&rdquo; The culprit looked quietly at him
and said: &ldquo;How the hell could I?&rdquo; After a moment the admiral turned to
the captain and said meekly: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Alfred; how the hell could
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife of a well-known judge lost her cook, and since she had no
other recourse she rolled up her sleeves and for a week provided such
meals as the judge had not enjoyed since those happy days when they
didn&rsquo;t keep a cook. The judge&rsquo;s delight was so great that by way of
acknowledgment he presented his wife with a beautiful ermine coat.
Naturally the incident was noised about among their acquaintances and
a spirit of envious emulation was developed in certain quarters. Mrs.
Jerome, after reciting the story to her husband, asked, &ldquo;What do I
get, Jerry, if I will do the cooking for a week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of the week, dear, you&rsquo;ll get one of those long cr&ecirc;pe

<p>The private saluted and started to leave the room. He paused at the
